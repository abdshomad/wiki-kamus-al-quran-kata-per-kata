# File for turing test questions. Structure of the file is very simple, first
# line of a record is "--" which indicates new record (question). Second line
# is question and third line is right answer. You can add more answers to third
# separated by comma. Everything else is ignored, so you can use it as comments.
# In that case, please use something like "#" or "//" to make it clear it
# is comment. Comparing answers is case insensitive.
