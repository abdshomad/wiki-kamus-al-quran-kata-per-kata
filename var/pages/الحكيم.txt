147. AL HAKIIM (The wise) 2:32 (م ك ح)

Other derivatives: Wisdom 16:125, 38:20, judgment 5:42, order 5:1, 13:41, establish or make firm 22:52. These derivatives are associated with knowledge 2:32, information 6:18, might 2:129, accepting of repentance 24:10 being high 42:51. 

The Wise and The Judge are Attributes of Allah (SWT). He is the One Who has wisdom on the basis of which He judges and orders and the  judgment or order is firmly established. The meaning of Al Hakiim as the Wise suits when this Attribute is used with the Attributes, the knowing, the informed, but when it is used with the Attributes the Mighty and the High it may mean one Firmly Established, Unshakable.
