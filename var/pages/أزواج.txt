Allah (SWT) has created everything in pairs 36:36, 51:49, Heal one is one 112:1-4. On the day of resurrection the souls will be paired (probably with their respective bodies) 81:7. In paradise males will be paired with (or married to) ‘Huur’ meaning fair ones with wide beautiful eyes 44:54, they will have pure mates therein 3:15. It is stated in the Quran: “Enter the garden you and your mates”. 43:70, here ‘Azwaaj’ may mean companions of the same good qualities, similar appears to be the case in hell 37:22 because it is not necessary that both husband and wife together should deserve paradise or hell, either of them could be good or bad as in the case of the wife of Lut (PBH) being in fire and the wife of Firawn being in paradise 66:10-11.
