85. AAZAANIHIM (Their ears) 2:19 (ن ذ ا)

We hear through our ears 7:195 but if there is heaviness in the ears 31:7 i.e. something which filters out good, then in spite of the ears we do not hear or listen
7:179. The mention of remembering ears 69:12 indicates that, what we hear is recorded in our memory and can be displayed on the day of resurrection as a proof in favor of or against us 41:19-23. We fall asleep when our sense of hearing is taken away 18:11.

The ears are associated with the eyes 7:195 and the hearts 22:46. Derivatives of this alphabets also convey the sense of permission 9:43, order 24:36, announcement 7:44, taking notice of 2:279, response 84:2 and excuse 16:84.
