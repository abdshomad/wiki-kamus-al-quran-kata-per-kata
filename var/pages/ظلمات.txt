74. ZULUMAAT (Darknesses) 2:17 ( تٍ م ل ظ )

Allah (SWT) has made the light and darkness 6:1. Three types of darkness with respect to the material world are mentioned in the Quran. (1) The darkness at night 6:97. (2) Darkness in deep sea 24:40 and (3) Darkness in wombs 39:6. Nuur has always been used in the singular form whereas darkness has always been used in the plural form 13:16, 14:1, 35:20, 57:9 etc. because there is only one right path leading to paradise and many paths which mislead. Allah (SWT) takes out the believers from darkness and leads them towards light i.e. Nuur 2:257, 4:175. Those who deny the signs of A llah (SWT) are deaf, dumb and in darkness 6:39. 

The opposites of darkness are light and heat represented by the words ‘Ziyaaa’ as in the case of fi re 2:20 and ‘Barq’ 2:20. Nuur meaning pure light is also opposite of darkness 2:17.
