188. TATLUUN (You Read) 2:44 (و ل ت)

Other derivatives: Reading a book 29:48, reading the Quran 27:92 reading loud so as to be heard 45:8, tell 18:83. That which is read is associated with news 28:3, 5:27, writing 29:48, purification, teaching, law, wisdom 2:151, understanding 10:16 and practically following 2:102, 75:18. 

This indicates that reading the Quran involves wisdom, understanding, teaching and practically following it, thus reflecting it in faith and deed like the moon reflecting sunlight 91:1-2. This procedure was followed by our prophet (PBH) and his companions 2:121. 

In Vs 91:2 the term ‘Talaaha’ means ‘It (i.e. the moon) reflects it (i.e. the sunlight)’. Words framed from these derivatives convey the sense of reflection and we read only due to reflection, if there is no light or no reflection from the surface on which something is written then we cannot read. The term Tilaawat-i-Quran would thus mean reading by reflection (not just recitation) and further reflection of what is read, through faith and deed which is the best way of propagating Islam followed by our prophet (PBH) and his companions (R.A).
