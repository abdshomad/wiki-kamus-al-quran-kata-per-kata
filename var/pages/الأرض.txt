52. AL ARZ (The earth) 2:11 (ض ر أ)

This word has also been used for land 7:110, 9:2, but mostly it is used for the globe 13000 km in diameter which was created along with other heavenly bodies in six periods (or stages) 7:54 after the Big Bang 21:30.

It appears to have been created as an individual member of the solar system in 2 periods 41:9 during which period it was differentiated into 7 layers 65:12. Allah (SWT) holds it together with other heavenly bodies 35:41.The mountains came into existence and the food was provided in four geological Eras. (1) The Precambrian 600 to 3300 million years back. (2) Paleozoic 230 to 600 million years (3) Mesozoic 63 to 230 million years and Cenozoic, recent times to 63 million years back. These 4 Geological eras appear to be the same as 4 periods (or days) mentioned in the Holy Quran 41:10. Everything is attracted towards the earth 77:25-26. All the southern continents were joined together as ‘Gondwana Land’ and they drifted away to take their present position some 63 and odd million years back, this spreading of the earth is referred to in the Holy Quran 13:3, 79:27-32. Allah (SWT) has provided mountains in the earth for the balance between the elevated land masses and the sea floor, in the absence of which the earth would have been in continuous disturbance. This is known as ‘Isostacy’ 16:15. The earth was hot earlier and has cooled down which involves contracting 13:41. Allah (SWT) has thus made earth habitable for human beings 20:53, 27:61, 78:6-7. All living beings are provided food by Allah (SWT) 11:6, He provides livelihood to us too 7:10, He sends down the water belonging to the earth 11:44 as rain 16:65, 22:63, 80:25-26, He has subdued it 67:15 providing all things for mankind 2:29. Mankind itself was developed from the earth as a growth 11:61, 53:32, 71:17, this may refer to the food from the earth through which the sperm and the egg are produced and through which our bodies grow. Mankind has been made ‘Incharge’ of the earth as ‘Khalifa’ 2:30, 6:165, to be tested for reward or punishment 45:22. Before resurrection Allah (SWT) will bring out a creature from the earth 27:82. Allah (SWT) knows what the earth absorbs from our body after our death, it is in a protected record 50:4 and we will be raised from the earth 20:55, 30:25 when it will split from above us 50:44, 84:3. The earth will be made plain 89:21 after moving away the mountains 18:47, 69:14, 56:4, 73:14 and it will shine with the radiance of its Fosterer and judgment will be given 89:21- 22, 39:69, 14:48 when the infidels would wish that the earth were leveled with them 4:42, it will narrate her news 99:4-5. On the day of resurrection the earth will be in the grip of Allah (SWT) and the skies rolled up in His right hand 39:67.
