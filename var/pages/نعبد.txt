10. NAABUDU (We serve/worship) 1:4 (د ب ع)

The associated noun is ‘Abd’ translated as ‘slave’ who is a person under someone’s control, having no power on anything 16:75. We are required to serve only one God 9:31 i.e. Allah (SWT) as slaves 21:25, 51:56 and not to associate partners with Him 13:36 making our religion exclusively for Him 39:11. The whole creation including the angels 43:19 are slaves of Allah (SWT) 19:93. Polytheists serve and worship besides Allah (SWT) things which do not have control on anything 5:76, 16:73, 26:71, 29:17. Many of the objects of worship are just names 12:40. ‘Ibadat’ 4:172 conveys the sense of serving or worshipping Allah (SWT) as an obedient slave, i.e. practically implementing the Holy Quran in the manner illustrated by prophet Muhammed (PBH).
