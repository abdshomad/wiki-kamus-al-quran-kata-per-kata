595. TAYAMMAMU (Aim) 2:267 (م م ى) 

One derivative of these alphabets conveys the sense of aiming, intending or seeking to clean oneself by taking clean dust in the absence of water for ablution or bath, 4:43, 5:6. 

Another derivative ‘Al yamm’ means ri ver and not sea, (Bahr:see word no 209) 

This meaning of ‘river’ can be established from the fact that the box containing baby Musa (PBH) was put in the River (Nile) and not sea, because river water flows in one direction and was capable of carrying the box in a particular direct ion 20:39. Contrary to this sea or ocean waters do not flow in one particular direction. It may be noted that aims or intentions are also directional. 

When Firawn and his army were pursuing Musa (PBH) and Bani Israel, Musa (PBH) was ordered to strike the ‘Bahr’ i.e. the (Red) sea with his staff and thereby miraculously cause a dry path in the sea 20:77. The sea was thus split and each part on the two sides of the dry path became like a huge mountain thus allowing Bani Israel to cross it safely 26:63-65. When Firawn and his army entered the dry path pursuing Bani Israel, they were drowned, because the water that was stationary  like mountains was ordered to flow in that particular direction where Firawn and his army were present. Because the flow of water at the time of the drowning of Firawn and his army was in a particular direction it is stated th at they were drowned in ‘Alyamm’ and not ‘Bahr’ in all the verses narrating this incidence 7:136, 20:78, 28:40 and 51:40. Technically water flows in one particular direction in the case of a river and not a sea. One is forced to admire the appropriate selection of words in the whole of the Quran-----Firawn and his army were drowned in flowing water.
