267. AS SABT (Sabbath)  2:65 (ت ب س)

During the period of prophet Dawuud (PBH) some Israelites dwelt at Elath on the Red Sea. They were ordered not to fish on Sabbath i.e. Saturday as a mark of respect but the fish used to come in great numbers on Sabbath to tempt them. Some inhabitants dug ditches and cut canals from the sea for the fish to enter on Sabbath, then they prevented them from going back into the sea by disconnecting the ditches and canals and removed the fish on Sunday. They claimed that the fish came on Friday and were caught on Sunday, not Sabbath. Therefore they were  transformed into apes as a mark of punishment.
