26. RAZAQNAAHUM (We Provide them) 2:3 (ق ز ر)
 
Derived from the word ‘Rizq’ which is something that sustains life 30:40 like air, water 45:5, food 50:9, 2:60 etc. which are produced by the involvement and interaction of the sky and the earth (35:3). It sometimes conveys the sense of wealth, because it is through wealth that we can purchase commodities which can sustain life and which we are ordered to spend in the cause of Allah (S WT) for sustaining the poor 2:254. Martyrs 3:169 and those in paradise 2:25 too are provided with sustenance which is similar to what we are provided with in this world. Rizq is associated with means of livelihood 15:20 and clothing 2:233. It is Allah (SWT) who sustains life through ‘Rizq’ 11:6 bestowing more on some and less on others 13:26. He is the best of providers 62:11, in the sense that what others provide is only from that which He provide them. One of the Attributes of Allah (SWT) is ‘The Provider 51:58’ Al Razzaaq’.
