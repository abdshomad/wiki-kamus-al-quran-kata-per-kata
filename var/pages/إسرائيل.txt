175. ISRAAIL Israel (Yaquub PBH) 2:40

Prophet Ibrahim (PBH) had two sons Ismail and Ishaaq (PBT) 2:133 and after them prophethood was confined to their progeny 57:26. Yaquub (PBH) also known as Israel 3:93 was the son of Ishaaq (PBH) 12:6, 2:132. Banii Israel translated as the children of Israel are the descendants of Yaquub or Israel (PBH) whose native place was Palestine. On the invitation of Yousuf (PBH) so n of Israel (PBH), the whole family of Israel migrated to Egypt 12:100 (between 19th to 17 century B.C). They were honoured very much due to their relationship with Yousuf (PBH). They became a big community consisting of 12 tribes 7:160 within 400 years but were gradually converted to serve as slaves of the ruling Egyptians 2:49. They were ultimately delivered from the tortures of the Egyptians through Musa (PBH) 44:30, 10:90-93 who took them back towards Palestine (somewhere between 14th to 12th century B.C). After Musa (PBH) Dawood (PBH) 5:78, Sulaiman (PBH) and Isa (PBH) 5:72 were the prominent messengers of Allah (SWT) in the progeny of Ishaaq (PBH). After a long history of ups and downs they were forced out of Palestine. Their largest group migrated to and settled down in Madina in anticipation of the fulfillment of the prophecy that the last messenger (PBH) of Allah (SWT) 33:40 was to appear in Arabia. They were expecting that the last prophet would be from among the Banii Israel, therefore they were envious 2:109 when Muhammed (PBH) from, the descendants of Ismael (PBH) was chosen by Allah (SWT) as His last messenger and consequently started opposing him. Since the state of Israel was carved out in late forties, thousands of Jews have migrated to this state which is predicted in the Quran as follows: And We said to the children of Israel after him (Firawn). Dwell in the earth, but when the promise of the hereafter comes to pass, we will bring you together (as a gathering of people coming from different directions) 17:104.
