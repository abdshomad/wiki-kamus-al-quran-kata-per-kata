376. AL JAHIIM (The hell fire) 2:119 (م ح ج)

The opponents of Ibrahiim (PBH) said, “.......... put him into Jahiim” 37:97. Elsewhere 21:69 Allah (SWT) ordered “O fire! be cool and a source of peace for Ibrahiim ” This indicates that the Jahiim mentioned at many places in the Quran means hell fire with which the word of kindling is also associated 81:12.
