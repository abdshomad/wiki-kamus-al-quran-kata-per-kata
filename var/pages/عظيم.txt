The word ‘Al-azmu’ from the same root alphabets means ‘bones’ which get weak in old age 19:4. Bones form a basic internal structural frame work. Vertebrates would lose their external form and function if their bones are removed. They are normally not visible and perform their functions from inside, their strength being exhibited by the external form. In this sense they are partly responsible for the quality known as strength, which is essential for life. 

‘Aziim’ associated with most of the nouns, appears to convey the sense of the great degree or intensity of some quality or the other and not the size .

Al Aziim is one of the Attributes of Allah 2:255 signifying intensive Greatness compared to ‘Al Kabiir’ probably signifying extensive Greatness.
