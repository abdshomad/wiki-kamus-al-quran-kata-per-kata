25. AS SALAAT (The Worship) 2:3 (و ل ص) 

The message of Shuaib (PBH) to his people was: “O my people serve/worship Allah, there is no god for you other than Him...” 11:84 In reply to this his people asked hi m, “O Shuaib does your worshipping (salaatuka) enjoin on you (the condition) that we should give up that which our fathers worshipped (ya’-budu).......”. 11:87. Here the word ‘salaat’ appears to refer to the process of ‘worshipping’ Allah (SWT) adopted by Shuaib (PBH) which was obviously different from the process of worshipping idols. ‘Salaat’ thus conveys the sense of ‘The formal process of worshipping Allah (SWT)’. 

It is conveyed through the holy Quran that whosoever is in the universe is obedient to Allah (SWT) 2:116, they all bow down to Him 16:49, 22:18 and glorify Him 62:1. We too offer ‘salaat’ in obedience to the orders of Allah (SWT) 2:110 and during the salaat we perform the ‘sajda’ i.e. bow down or prostrate 22:77 glorifying Him 48:9 by pronouncing ‘Subhana Rabbiyal A ‘ala’ We are informed through the Holy Quran that everyone in the universe knows its ‘Salaat’ and 
‘Tasbiih’24:41. Here the word ‘salaat’ appears to mean ‘The process of submission to Allah (SWT)’ which consists of being busy obeying His orders (‘Tasbih’ is derived from the same root alphabets as ‘sabha’ which also means ‘being busy’ 73:7 and the word ‘sajada’ means ‘bowing down ’). The word ‘salawaat’ and other derivatives from the same root alphabets convey the sense of ‘Rahmat’ meaning ‘Mercy’ 2:157, 33:43,33:56 ‘Salaat’ can therefore be defined as ‘A formal procedure of emotional, mental and physical submission for worshipping Allah (SWT) seeking His Mercy’. 

We are ordered to monitor our salaat 2:238 being constant at it 70:23, ordering our people to do so 20:132, be regular at the Friday congregational worship 62:9 and shorten the salaat during wars 4:101-102, salaat is to be offered for remembering Allah (SWT) 20:14 keeping our voice low 17:110 and observing proper timings 11:114, 17:78 after performing wazu 5:6. Ibrahim (PBH) prayed for making him and his off-spring establishers of salaat 14:40. Items which are associated with salaat are :Truth 75:31, sacrifice 108:2, peace 33:56, belief 2:3, 9:18, za kat 2:43, patience and help 2:45, remembrance of Allah (SWT) 4:103 guarding against evil 6:72, 30:31, spending 8:3, obeying Allah (SWT) and His messenger 9:71, seeking Allah’s (SWT) attention 13:22, serving Allah (SWT) 20:14, doing good 21:73 humility 23:2, Quran 29:45, 35:29, enjoining good, forbidding bad 31:17, fearing Allah (SWT) 35:18, responding to Allah (SWT) 42:38 merciful turning of Allah (SWT) 58:13, loan to Allah (SWT) 73:20, being upright 98:5, time for rest 24:58 etc. 

Things which spoil salaat are :- Intoxicants 4:43 lethargy 4:142, 9:54, lust 19:59, trade 24:37, heedlessness 107:5 etc. Benefits of salaat are : it keeps one away from indecency (shameful deeds) and things not recognized (as good) 29:45, hearts find peace and tranquility through it 13:28, it is one of the important items which will help in achieving paradise 23:1-11.
