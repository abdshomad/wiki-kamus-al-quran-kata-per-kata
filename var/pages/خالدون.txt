122. KHAALIDUUN (They will stay) 2:25 (د ل خ)
 
Paradise has been specified as the place for staying (khuld) 25:15 but elsewhere it is stated that the inhabitants will stay there forever 4:57. Similarly for hell it is stated that the inmates will stay there in 9:68 but elsewhere it is stated that they will stay therein forever 4:169. This indicates that the derivatives of these alphabets convey the sense of ‘staying forever’. This meaning is also evident from the so called tree of immortality through which the devil deceived Adam (PBH) 20:120, 7:20. It is stated that ‘khuld’ meaning immortality in this world was not assigned to anyone because every soul tastes death 21:34-35 Clinging (Akhlada) to the earth 7:176 would mean always remaining with earthy or worldy things in the life of this world. Staying or remaining in paradise or hell for ever is subject to the will of Allah (SWT) 6:128, 11:107-108 who has full authority on everything.
