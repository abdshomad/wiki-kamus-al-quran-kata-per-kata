1537. MUHAMMED (PBH) 47:2 (د م ح)

Name of the last messenger of Allah (SWT) Muhammed (PBH) was brought up as an orphan 93:6. Before the Holy Quran was revealed to him by Allah (SWT) through the Spirit Jibriil (PBH) 26:192-196, he had not known reading and writing, had he known then people would have thought that he was the author of the Quran 29:48 He had no knowledge of the Divine law and belief (Imaan), Allah (SWT) taught him these things through the holy Quran 42:52 He was a human being 10:2, 18:110. His prophethood was announced through earlier Divine books and messengers of Allah (SWT) 3:81, 7:157, 61:6.

He had not expected that he would be chosen as a messenger of Allah (SWT) and that the Quran would be revealed to him 28:86. He was not a sooth sayer, not under the influence of any Jinn or magic 52:29, 25:8 and 9. He was neither a poet 36:69 nor one who forged a lie 42:24. We have to accept him as the last messenger of Allah 4:170, 7:158, 48:29 and the last in the series of all the messengers of Allah (SWT) 33:40. Further we are to regard him as a model to be copied, obeying all his orders 33:21 and 71. His duty was just to communicate the message of Allah (SWT) 3:20, 4:80, 13:40. He was not given the power to guide whom he liked but Allah (SWT) guides through him, whom He wills 28:56, He was asked by Allah (SWT) to announce that he did not have knowledge of the unseen and did not have power to benefit or harm even himself 6:50, 72:21. He was instructed to propagate Islam through the Quran 50:45. He was softhearted towards the believers being desirous for their good, full of pity and mercy 3:159, 9:128. He conveyed to the believers the good news of enjoyment in paradise, warned the nonbelievers regarding the punishment in hell, invited people towards Allah (SWT) and thus served as a lamp giving light to help people come out of the darkness of ignorance towards the brightness of Islam and he will be a witness on the day of resurrection against those who did not accept his invitation 33:45-46. He was sent for the benefit of the whole mankind till the end of the world 34:28 so as to make Islam prevail 9:33, probably in this sense he has been mentioned as Rehmatallil aalamiin, meaning ‘mercy for the worlds’ 21:107. He taught the Quran and its interpretation to his followers through his own practice 2:151. He was helped by Allah (SWT) and the angels, in his mission of propagating Islam, who also showered mercy on him 22:15, 66:4. Believers are required to pray to Allah (SWT) for showering His mercy and peace on him 33:56 and he is to be regarded, by the believers, closerer than their ownselves 33:6. When Allah (SWT) and His messenger (PBH) have given a decision in any affair, it does not befit a believer to exercise his own choice 33:36. People will not be considered believers if they do not go by his judgment in their disputes 4:65. The duty of Muslims is to implement the Quran in their lives as Muhammed (PBH) had taught them 3:31, 4:59 4:80, 33:71.

Some of the owners of other Divine books recognized him still they did not accept him as the messenger of Allah (SWT) 2:146, 5:15.

His opponents will be made to enter hell 4:115. He was asked to ignore the infidels leaving them to do what they wished to 10:41, 13:43.

There are two miraculous events associated with him which are reported in the Quran :splitting of the moon 54:1-2, and his journey from Mecca to Jerusalem in one night 17:1. On the day of resurrection he will complain against his people that they had forsaken the Quran i.e. they had not implemented it in their lives 25:30. He will be a witness over people here and the hereafter 2:143, 73:15, 16:89. He will be raised to Muqaam Mahmooda ‘The praised position Insha Allah 17:79.
