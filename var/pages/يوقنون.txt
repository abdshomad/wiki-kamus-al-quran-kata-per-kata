30. YUUQINUUN (They are certain) 2:4 (ن ق ى)

Yaqiin means certainty. We are required to be certain of the life after death 2:4 and meeting our Fosterer Allah(SWT) 13:2 

Certainty is associated with truth 56:95, knowledge 102:5, knowledge of the kingdom of the skies and the earth 6:75, seeing and hearing 32:12, 102:7, insight, mercy 45:20, service/worship 15:99, salaat and za kat 31:4, guidance, patience 32:24, news 27:22. 

The opposite of certainty appears to be ‘Zann’ meaning doubt or conjecture 45:32.
