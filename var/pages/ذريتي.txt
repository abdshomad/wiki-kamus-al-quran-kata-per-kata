380. ZURRIYYAH (Off Spring) 2:124 (ر ر ذ)

The word zarrah 4:40 means a particle. Children and descendants are created from sperm and egg and their associated genes, which can be regarded as particles. Is it due to this reason that some derivatives of these alphabets have been translated as children 2:266 and descendants 19:58 

It is stated in the Quran that Allah (SWT) had taken out their descendants from the backs of children (i.e.progeny) of Adam (PBH) and made them bear witness that He was their Fosterer 7:172-174. Were these ‘descendants’ translation of the word ‘zurriyyat’ some specific ‘genes of faith’?
