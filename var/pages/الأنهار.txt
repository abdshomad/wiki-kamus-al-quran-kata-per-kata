118. AL- ANHAAR (The Rivers) 2:25 (ر ﻩ ن)

This word means rivers 2:74 which have been compelled to follow the laws of Allah (SWT) for serving mankind 14:32. We use rivers for irrigation, navigation, power generation food etc. In paradise there are rivers of water, milk, wine and honey 47:15. 

The word An Nahaar is used to mean a day which is opposite of night 2:164. Allah (SWT) measures out the night and the day 73:20. This measuring out is so precise that on any day of a solar year the timings of sun rise and sun set are the same every year. The night is made to enter the day and the day is made to enter the night 3:27 indicating a gradual and not an abrupt change. Allah (SWT) makes the night to cover the day 7:54 i.e. the earth comes between us and the sun which causes darkness or night on our side. He winds the night over the day and the day over the night 39:5. He causes the oscillation, (turning and returning at regular intervals) of the night and the day 24:44. The day slips off from the night 36:37 and the night cannot out strip the day 36:40 i.e. we cannot miss a day. The day unveils the sun and the night covers it 91:3-4, 92:1-2. All these verses of the Quran indicate the rotation of the earth. If this rotation is stopped one half of the globe will permanently face the sun and the other half will face permanent darkness i.e. night 28:71-72 like the moon. 

Allah (SWT) has made the night for rest and has made things visible during the day time 10:67 when we rise 25:47 so that mankind might seek His grace 30:23 in the form of livelihood 78:11 and has thus compelled the night and the day to follow His laws for our service 14:33.
