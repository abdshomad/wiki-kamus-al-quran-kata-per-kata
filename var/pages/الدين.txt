9. D I I N (The judgment, law) 1:3 (ن ى د)
 
The word ‘Diin’ has been specifically used in the sense of ‘Law’ as ‘Diin-il-Malik’ meaning ‘law of the king’ 12:76. It conveys the sense of religion which is again a set of laws 110:2. The final religion is Al-Islam i.e. the final ‘law’ of Allah 3:19 which is perfect 5:3. Nothing can be added to or subtracted from it, based on it people will be judged on the day of judgment and rewarded or punished and no other religion (Law) will be accepted by Allah (SWT) 3:85. This ‘Law’ is to be understood for its proper implementation 9:122 and propagated 2:193 so that it prevails over all other religions 9:33 but with no compulsion 2:256. Everything in the creation, willingly or unwillingly follows the law of Allah (SWT) 3:83, His law prevails forever 16:52. The word ‘Dayn’ from the same root alphabets means ‘Loan’ 2:282 which also involves laws for repayment. Diin summarily means ‘Law’. Al-Islam’ is the Law for the peaceful existence of humanity just like the law of gravitation for the peaceful existence of the whole universe. Yawm-i-ddiin is also known as the period hereafter 2:8, day of resurrection 2:85, the great day 10:15, 11:3, encompassing day 11:84, the day which will be witnessed 11:103, the day account of deeds will be established 14:41, distressful day 11:77 the day, timing of which is known to Allah (SWT) only 15:38 barren day 22:55, the day of separation 37:21, the day of account 38:16, threatening day 50:20, the promised d ay 85:2 the day of coming out (of the earth) 50:42, a day of difficulty 54:8, day of gathering 64:9, the day of manifestation of misappropriations 64:9 real day 78:39, weighty day 76:27 etc.
