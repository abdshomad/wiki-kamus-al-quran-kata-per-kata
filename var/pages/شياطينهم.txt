58. SHAYAATINIHIM (Their devils) 2:14 (ن ط شj) 

Shaytaan is the same as Ibliis the devil, who was associated with Adam (PBH) 2:34-36, 7:27. Ibliis belongs to the category of the jinn having descendants 18:50, a tribe 7:27, and an army 26:95. Probably all the three words refer to his progeny, like the progeny of Adam (PBH) about whom he had said that he would bring them under his control except a few. It appears that one member from his progeny is associated with one member of the progeny of Ad am (PBH) which is also indicated in one of the sayings of Prophet Muhammed (PBH) reported under word No 42:1. He has been created to distinguish between the believers in the hereafter and others who are in doubt about it 34:21 probably due to his deceptive temptation through his evil instigations 4:120. Ibliis did not bow down before Adam (PBH) considering himself better than him and claiming superiority and seniority that he was created earlier from fire (energy) whereas Adam (PBH) was created from clay (matter). Therefore Allah (SWT) drove him away, but he sought His permission and promised that he would mislead mankind from the straight path leading to paradise except those who serve/worship only Allah (SWT). Allah (SWT) too announced that He would fill hell with him and his followers 7:11-18, 38:82-83, 17:64. Ibliis deceived Adam and Hawwa (PBT) tempting them to eat from the forbidden tree, due to which their shame became manifest and Allah (SWT) sent them out of the garden 2:36, 7:19-25. 

The devil is an open enemy of mankind therefore he should not be obeyed, worshipped or served 36:60. He enjoins on mankind only evil and that which is indecent 2:168-169, 24:21. Friends of devils, i.e. those who follow his evil suggestions, are at loss 4:119. The devil tempts mankind 7:27, makes false promises, ex cites vain desires 4:120, causes to forget good things 6:68, makes evil deeds fair-seeming 6:43, involves people in intoxicants and games of chance to evoke mutual hatred and enmity 5:90-91 spoils social relations through conversation, we are therefore ordered to speak that which is the best 17:53, makes people afraid of poverty while  spending for a good cause 2:268 and he causes weakening uneasiness during wars with infields 8:11. If we do not remember Allah (SWT) i.e. if we do not always keep Him in mind, He Himself appoints a devil on us who turns us away from the right path but we think that we are rightly guided 43:36-37. The devil also makes people forget the remembrance of Allah (SWT) 58:19. Devils are from the jinn as we ll as human beings 6:112,114:1-6. Devils were made to work for Sulaymaan (PBH) 38:36-38, 21:82. The sky has been protected from them and if any one seeks to steal a hearing a clear flame follows him 15:16-18, 37:6-10, 67:5. Divine communications cannot be polluted by them 22:52-54. They have not come down with the Quran and it does not suit them, they have been kept away even from listening to it 26:210- 212, 81:25. 

We should seek the protection of Allah (SWT) from the evil instigation's of the devils and remember Him when we feel their influence on us, then we will star t seeing aright 7:200-201. We should seek the protection of Allah (SWT) while  reciting the Quran 16:98-100. We should always pray to Allah (SWT) seeking His protection in accordance with the instructions given in 23:97-98 and 114:1-6.
