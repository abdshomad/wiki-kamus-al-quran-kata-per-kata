382. AL BAYT (The House) 2:125 (ت ى ب)

Other derivatives: Spending the night (in discussing secrets) 4:81. Houses 24:61 are places where people not only rest but also discuss or are involved in secrets. Allah (SWT) calls Kaaba 5:97 ‘My house’ 22:26, mosques 24:36 are also called houses and there are some people who spend the night in prostrating and standing before Allah (SWT) 25:64. In view of all this it appears that the Kaaba and mosques are not only places for ritualistic worship but also for secrecy with Allah (SWT).
