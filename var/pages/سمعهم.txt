37. SAM-‘IHIM (Their hearing) 2:7 (ع م س) 

Our hearing is through our ears 7:195, it is associated with seeing 32:12, 76:2 knowledge 2:127, heart/mind 2:7 and with understanding 25:44, the opposite of which is deafness 10:42. The derivatives of these root alphabets sometimes convey the sense of ‘listen’, meaning obey or respond 6:36, 2:285, the opposite of which is disobedience 2:93. Some people hear but do not understand because of the seal on their hearts/minds 7:100, 45:23 and heaviness in their ears 6:25. We should be thankful to Allah (SWT) for His gift of hearing 16:78. Our hearing will be questioned, whether we used to hear good things or bad things 17:36 and it will bear witness on the day of resurrection probably as a sound record in our memory, like an audio tape, giving evidence of what we used to hear, the Quran or music 41:20-22, people will hear in the life after death on the day of resurrection 50:23, the roaring in the hell 67:7, 25:12 and in paradise they will not hear useless talk 88:11.
 
When the Quran is recited we are required to listen to it observing silence 7:204. Divine communication ‘ Wahi’ was audible to Musa (PBH) 20:13. 

Allah (SWT) is One who hears 2:127, listens to our prayer 3:38 i.e. accepts our prayers being the Nearest Hearer 34:50. He has full control on our hearing 10:31 and if He wills He can take away our hearing 2:20. 

The dead do not hear 27:80 nor those who are in the graves 35:22. The Jinn heard the Quran 46:29, 72:1, the devils have been kept away from hearing it 26:212. The high esembly is not audible to the devils 37:6-10.
