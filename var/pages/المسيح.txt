652. AL MASIIH (PBH) 3:45 (ح س م)

The full name of messenger of Allah (SWT) sent to Bani Israel after Musa (PBH) was Al Masiihu Isa bnu Maryam (PBT). Derivatives of these alphabets convey the sense of wiping something to clean it 4:43, 5:6 and passing one’s hand over something 38:33. In view of this, does the  word ‘Al Masiihu’ convey the sense of one who wipes off uncleanliness from his community when his disciples too were ‘Al Hawaa-riyyuun’ meaning ‘Those who wash clothes’ 3:52 and thus clean them? (see word no. 318 for more details)
