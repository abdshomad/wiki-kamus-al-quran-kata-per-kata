606. AS-SADAQAAT (The charity) 2:276 (ق د ص)

These derivatives are also used to mean dowries of women which are to be given as a free gift 4:4. 

In connection with charity we are required to realize that everything in the universe including our wealth and property belongs to Allah (SWT) 2:284, 4:39. It is He Who has made some people rich and others poor 34:39 to test them 6:165. He has ordered the rich to spend their wealth on the poor i.e. wealth is to flow from the rich to the poor 59:7, just like water which flows from a higher level to a lower level or electric current which flows from a high er potential to a lower potential, which is the natural law.

We are required to spend 2:195, 2:110 the good things we love 3:92 which are in surplus 2:219 and not to give bad things in charity which we would ourselves hesitate to accept 2:267. We are ordered to spend on parents, relatives, orphans, needy (those who beg and those who abstain from begging), wayfarer, officials administering charities those whose hearts are to be reconciled, freeing the slaves, those in debt and in the way of Allah (SWT) (during periods of war etc) 2:215, 2:273, 9:60, 51:19, 57:10, 90:12-16. 

We should spend day and night, openly for prompting others and secretly to avoid show business 2:271, 2:274, 14:31. We should neither be extravagant nor niggardly 25:67. Charity is associated with fasting and sacrifice 2:196 and its opposite is usury 2:276, 30:39 where the flow of money is reversed, i.e. the rich literally suck the money from the poor which is strictly prohibited 2:278-279. 

We are required to give charity out of love for Allah (SWT) to please Him and thereby seek His Attention and nearness 2:265, 9:99. Charity is meant for self purification and it is not meant for receiving favours in return 9:103, 74:6. After giving charity to someone we should not stress our obligation on him nor annoy him because the wealth given in charity does not belong to us 2:3. Charity should not be given with the intention of attracting the attention of others, that they may call us generous 2:264. 

We should not swear that we would not give charity to particular relatives or the poor due to some fault of theirs 24:22. The infidels spend their wealth to stop people from the way of Allah (SWT) 8:36 and not spending in the way of Allah (SWT) is one of the acts of hypocrisy and polytheism 9:75-77, 41:6-7. Those who spend in the way of Allah (SWT) will get a reward 700 times or even mo re than that provided they do not stress their obligation, do not annoy and do not show off 2:261-262,272 such people will go to paradise 76:8-12. Those who do not give charity will be at a loss both in this world 68:17-20 and in the hereafter and they will be branded with their wealth, heated in the fire of hell, which they had hoarded 9:34-35, 47:38.
