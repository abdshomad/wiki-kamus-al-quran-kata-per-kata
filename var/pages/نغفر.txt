233. NAGFIRLAKUM (We will forgive you) 2:58 (ر ف غ)

Other derivatives: (1) Forgiving past sins 8:38 (2) Not harming an opponent by retaliation, revenge or punishment but bearing his injustice with patience 42:43 and protection from defaming the needy 2:63 (3) Protection from future sins 2:286. In the prayers at the end of this Chapter, one who is conscious of his sins would first ask for pardon or forgiveness ‘Afuannaa’ for the sins he has already committed. There is no point is his further asking for forgiveness saying ‘wagfir lanaa’ as this word is normally translated. Here ‘wagfir lanaa’ appears to mean ‘And protect us’ (from committing any sin in future) because two words in any language do not normally convey exactly the same meaning. ‘Magfiratun’ in such situations would mean protection from sins rather than forgiveness of sins. Keeping in view the relationship between prevention and cure, if we consider sin as a disease, then ‘Magfiratun’ would mean seeking preventive protection from possible future sin, in advance, and ‘Afwwun’ meaning pardon, would be the cure for the sin already committed. How can there be forgiveness without protection or safety from the deserved punishment ? Therefore ‘Magfiratun’ appears to convey a dual sense (1) preventive protection from possible future sins and (2) consequent protection from the deserved punishment for the sins already committed. 

‘Liyagfiralaka’ and ‘zambika’ in 48:2 have been translated by many popular translators as ‘that He may forgive you, your sin ‘or fault’ referring to our prophet Muhammed (PBH).The very idea of our prophet having committed a sin is wrong because it contradicts the Quran which about our prophet (PBH) states : - 

‘And you (Muhammed (PBH)) are certainly of an excellent character’ 68:4. 

‘By the Quran full of wisdom, you (Muhammed (PBH)) are certainly (one) of the messengers on the straight path’ 36:2-4. 
 
In the messenger of Allah (Muhammed (PBH)), there is indeed a good example for you to follow ........33:21. 

By the star when it sets, your companion (Muhammed (PBH)) neither went astray nor was he misled 53:1-2. 

............ you (Muhammed (PBH)) are certainly on clear truth 27:79. and then the final challenge :- 

“Say ................... I (Muhammed (PBH)) have indeed lived a life time among you before it (i.e. the Quran was revealed)!” 10:16. 

In view of these verses of the Quran, the right translation of the verse using the term Liyag firalaka’ would be “that He may protect you from every sin of yours which you (could) send in advance and which you (could) leave behind” 48:2. 

This protective forgiveness by Allah (SWT) is for all sins 39:53, mistakes 20:73, evils 7:153, injustice 13:6 etc., except polytheism 4:48, for polytheists forgiveness is not to be sought 9:113. Allah (SWT) punishes whom He wills and protectively forgives whom He wills 5:18. We are ordered to seek the protective forgiveness of Allah (SWT) 41:6. Protective forgiveness is associated with pardon, overlooking 64:14, mercy 7:23, setting things right 33:71, belief 46:36, repentance 40:7, glorification and praising Allah (S WT) 110:2, patience and striving in the path of Allah (SWT) 16:110, grace of Allah (SWT) 2:268, truth 3:17, paradise 2:221. 

The words giving opposite meanings are punishment 2:284 and anger 42:37. Three derivatives of these alphabets are used for three Attributes of Allah (SWT). Al Gaffaar 20:82, Al Gafuur 2:173 and Al Gaafir 40:3 conveying the meaning of One Who is Protectively Forgiving. These Attributes are used along with other Attributes like Merciful 2:173, Clement 2:225, Pardoning 22:60, Rabb 34:15, Mighty 35:28, One Who acknowledges 35:30. Loving 85:14, etc. 

Allah (SWT), if He wills to, forgive sins already committed, protecting from the deserved punishment, and protects from committing any sin in future. He is thus Protectively Forgiving.
