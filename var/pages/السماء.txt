80. ASSAMAAA (The sky) 2:19 (و م س)

The sky is the space above our heads wherever we are on the spherical earth, i.e. regions beyond the earth upwards 50:6, 21:32. It is the direction from which water as rain comes down 2:22. It has been organized into seven higher levels or systems (samawaat) in two periods or stages 2:29, 41:11-12. The seven layers or systems are in accordance with each other 67:3, 71:15. Allah (SWT) holds it from falling down on the earth 22:65, 30:25. The sky contains clouds 2:164, thunderbolts 18:40, the galaxies, the sun, the moon 25:61, the planets 37:6, the stars 41:12, the guards probably the black holes, flames 72:8 and orbits of heavenly bodies 51:7, 23:17. The sky are expanding 51:47. All heavenly bodies are raised 88:18 without any visible support 13:2. 

All the heavenly bodies including the earth were joined together and Allah (SWT) separated them 21:30 and gave the present structure in six periods or stages 11:7 providing perfect balance 55:7. The heavenly bodies are real not an illusion 14:19. 

Allah (SWT) is the Originator 2:117, the Initiator of creation 6:14 and the proportioner 6:1 of the skies and the earth. He has full control on them 2:107, everything in them belongs to Him 2:116, 2:284. He has knowledge of everything including the unseen 2:33, 3:29, 27:75. His chair i.e. throne extends over them 2:255 and His is the command 32:5 and finally He will inherit them 3:180. 

He has compelled everything in the skies and the earth to serve mankind 31:20, 45:13 i.e. everything in the universe is fine tuned to suit human life on earth known as the Anthropic principle of the universe. The purpose of creating the skies and the earth is to test human beings and reward them accordingly 45:22. We are invited to reflect on them 34:9, 3:191. Everything in them glorifies Allah (SWT) 57:1 and submits to Him 16:49. 

Before the end a smoke will come from the sky and cover mankind which will be a painful punishment 44:10-11. The skies will be rolled up 39:67 due to which the heavenly bodies might come closer and closer increasing their mutual force of gravity which is probably hinted in 7:187 stating the event to be heavy. The end of the universe will involve whirling of the sky 52:9 and its splitting asunder 69:16, 73:18, 77:9, 78:19, 81:11, 82:1, 84:1 and it will become red like red hide 55:37 and molten brass 70:8 probably referring to the final crunch when all heavenly bodies will get concentrated at one place with a firy chaos just to rebounce into a new creation mentioned in 21:104 to give rise to new skies and a new earth 14:48, 36:81.
