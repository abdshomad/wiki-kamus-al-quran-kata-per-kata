At the same time we are not forbidden to be kind and just to those of the infidels who do not fight with us on account of our religion nor drive us out of our houses 60:8-9. We should not obey the infidels a nd on the contrary, should strive against them 25:52.

‘Kafara’ also means to be ungrateful 27:40 i.e. not to acknowledge the obligations of others or not to accept them as obligors. ‘Kuffaar’ means farmers 57:20 and ‘Kaffara’ means wiping off or removal of the ill effects of sin or expiation of oaths 5:89 or compensation for covering up some fault 5:95.

‘Kufr’, meaning infidelity, too conveys the sense of hiding or covering up the inherent belief 7:172-174 in all human beings, by external rejection. [before coming into this world all human beings were made to bear witness that Allah (S WT) alone is our Fosterer so that we may not become polytheists who are also infidels 7:172-174].
