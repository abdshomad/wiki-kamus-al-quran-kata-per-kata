42.1 ANNAAS (The mankind) 2 :8 (س ن أ)
 
In the Quran four different words are used for man 1. Ins. 2. Insaan. 3. Annaas and 4. Bashar. Let us study them in this order and see how the Quran explains and differentiates them. 

42.1 Ins: The term ‘Aanastu’ derived from these alphabets means ‘I perceive’. 20:10. Perception is knowledge or cognizance by the organs of sense. We are asked to seek permission ‘Tasta’-nisuu’ before entering houses 24:27 so as to make ourselves recognized and develop familiarity. We are ordered to hand over the wealth of orphans to them when we find or recognize ‘aanastum’ in them the capacity for correct judgment 4:6. 
 
Perception, familiarity and recognition are abstract in nature. The same alphabets are used for man as ‘Ins’ probably referring to his psychic personality which is also abstract and not visible and which can be influenced by another invisible being ‘The jinn’ because they are reported to say that human beings sought their protection and they increased these human beings in error 72:6. On the day of gathering too this Jinn will be blamed for misleading human beings to hell 6:128. Ibn- i-Masood (R.A.) reports that the messenger (PBH) of Allah (SWT) said, “There is not one among you who does not have an in charge on him accompanying him one from among the jinn and (one) accompanying him from among the angels. The companions asked. “For you too, O messenger (PBH) of Allah (SWT)”. He replied, “For me too, but Allah (SWT) has helped me against him (jinn), so I am at peace and he enjoins on me nothing but good”. (Muslim) The angel could be our conscience and the Jinn could be the evil desire associated with our psychic personality, which act as opposing forces. Throughout the Quran the word ‘Ins’ meaning man has always been used with the word ‘Jinn’, i.e. it has not been used separately. 

Both have been addressed together as a company or assembly of close associates (Ma-shar), indicating their intimacy 55:33. The purpose of creating both is ‘Ibadat’ meaning serving or worshipping Allah (SWT) 51:56. Devils too are from both Jinn as we ll as human beings 6:112 and both beings will be in hell 7:38 and 179 and in paradise 55:46-77. 

All these facts indicate that ‘Ins ’ refers to the psychic personality associated with our physical or biological body:- ‘The conscious Self’ also known as the ‘The soul’ The Nafs. 

42.2 INSAAN: Insaan, it is stated, that it was created from nothing 19:67, i.e before he was conceived in his mother’s womb (or before the creation of Adam PBH) he was physically or biologically non-existent, then his biological creation was started through mud 15:26 and clay 23:12, 55:14 referring to the origin of ma n or the food got from the earth which is responsible for the production of sperm and egg. His progeny was created biologically from the sperm 36:77 and something that clings and hangs like a leech 96:2. 

Man as ‘Insaan’ has been created weak 4:28. In adversity he prays to Allah (SWT) but when the harm is removed he behaves as if he had not prayed 10:12, he becomes despairing and ungrateful 11:9. 

In prosperity he is exultant, and boastful 11:10 and keeps away from praying 17:83. He is unjust 14:34, hasty 17:11, 21:37, 70:19, niggardly 17:100, quarrelsome 18:54 exceeding limits 75:5, rebelling 96:6 displaying ignorance 33:72. The devil is an open enemy of ‘Insaan’ instigating evil 17:53 due to which they fight with each other like animals. He has been bestowed with ‘Nafs’ i.e. consciousness 39:42 which is the driving force and Allah (SWT) knows what this ‘Nafs’ of his whispers to the physical body making it act accordingly 50:16. Knowledge 96:5, 2:255 and speech 55:4 are gifts of Allah (SWT) to man as a biological species which differentiates him from animals. With all these qualities he has to strive and there is nothing for him except that which he strives for and his striving is seen by Allah (SWT) who will reward him accordingly 53:39-41. Even as biological being he has to be good to his parents 29:8, 31:14. On the day of resurrection his bones will be gathered to the extent that even his fingertips will be put in order 75:3-4 i.e. he will be biologically recreated. He will be conscious on that day seeking a place to flee 75:10. He will be informed of all his deeds 5:13 being a witness against his own ‘conscious self’, the Nafs 75:14 which was responsible for all his beliefs and actions. Man has been created to be tested 45:22, 67:2. so that the successful may enjoy in paradise and the failures may be punished in hell. 

42.3 Annaas: Human beings as Annaas were created from a single soul (Adam PBH) 4:1, from one male and one female (Adam and Hawwa PBT) 49:13, from the soil 22:5, from wh ic h we get our food which in turn produces the sperm and the egg. They were a single community but later they differed 2:213, 10:19. The phase ‘Annaas’ did not originate from mud or clay like ‘Insaan’ or ‘Bashar’ . Allah (SWT), having bestowed some inherent qualities in man as a biological species i.e. ‘Insaan’, introduced into him the natural urge to follow Islam 30:30 and sent down Towraah, Injiil etc, Quran being the final Divine revelation 3:3-4, 2:185 for their guidance and sent Muhammed (PBH) the last messenger in the long list of messengers of Allah, to the whole humanity 33:40, 34:28. 

The majority of human beings does not know that it is Allah (SWT) who enlarges or straitens their provision for whom He wills 34:36. We are ordered to serve and worship Him to save ourselves from the punishment 2:21. As “Annaas” we are required to guard ourselves against evil 2:187, seek His pleasure 2:207 and reflect 59:21. But among human beings there are many who are foolish 2:142, polytheists 2:165, greedy for long worldly life 2:96, ungrateful 2:243, 40:61, having lusty feelings, liking glamorous worldly things 3:14, transgressors 5:49 because they follow the devil 22:3. When Allah (SWT) makes human beings (Annaas) taste mercy they plan against His message 10:21 and when harm afflicts them they pray to Him, but again when he makes them taste mercy some of them associate partners with Him 30:33. Corruption appears in this world because of the evils of human beings as Annaas 30:41. 
 
Allah (SWT) brings about ups and downs in the lives of human beings to mark out the believers taking witnesses from among them 3:140. On the day of resurrection mankind will stand before Allah (SWT) 83:6, 101:4. The fuel of hell will be human beings and stones 2:24 along with the Jinn 11:119, 32:13, therefore we should repeatedly pray for safety from the evils instigated by the devils 114:1-6 and the fire 2:201. ‘Annas’ thus appears to be the ‘Social Man’ obeying and disobeying the orders of Allah (SWT) 

42.4 BASHAR : This word used for man appears to convey the sense of ‘News Giver’ like ‘Basheer’ 5:18-19 from the same root alphabets. If we analyze our interact ions with others and many of our routine activities, most of the time we are either receiving information from other sources or passing out information to others. Information technology itself has become an important aspect of human life. As Bashar, man was created from mud 15:33 and clay 38:71, the material used for creating Insaan, and from the soil from which was created Annaas 30:20. Bashar meaning ‘News giver’ seems to be a combination of the biological man ‘Insaan’ and the so cial man ‘Annas’. An additional material used in the creation of Bashar is water 25:54. Nothing has been mentioned about the material of creation of man as ‘Ins’, which again indicates that ‘Ins’ represents the invisible psychic personality of man- the conscious self, ‘The Nafs’. The word Bashar has sometimes been used for ordinary man 16:103 but mostly used for the messengers (PBT) of Allah (SWT) who convey information from Him to human beings 14:10. Jibrill (PBH) takes the form of a Bashar 19:17, he is we ll known as one who passes information from Allah (SWT) to His messengers (PBT). ‘Bashar’ is thus ‘the information processing man’. The two phases biological ‘Insaan’ and the social ‘Annaas’ appear to coordinate in elevating man to the state of ‘B ashar’ - an information processing being and all the three stages depend upon his psychic personality the Nafs or the conscious self i.e. ‘Ins ’. The biological, social and the psychic man in all the three states is susceptible to the influence of the devil. Primitive man and a child appear to be examples of the biological stage - ‘Insaan’; the civilized human race and a mature man the examples of the social stage - ‘Annaas’ and the most advanced stage of human beings conveying information from Allah (SWT) to their own race is represented by His messengers (P BT) known as ‘Basheer’. All the three stages being an expression of the internal ‘Ins’ - the conscious self the ‘Nafs’ the invisible driving force.
