Other derivatives: Creating, making, fabricating portioning something from something else: - creation of living beings from water 24:45, creation of jiin from firy heat 55:15, creation of man from sperm 16:4 etc., in proportion and out of proportion 22:5.

These derivatives are associated with Allah’s (SWT) command 7:54 knowledge 15:86 and fashioning 59:24 and their opposites convey the sense of decay 36:68 and death 30:40. 

Allah (SWT) created everything 6:102, He creates what He wills 28:68, He begins the creation and gets it reproduced 10:4 and His creation is perfect 27:88, 67:3-4. He creates the physical forms as well as their functions 87:1-3 and everything follows His command (Amr) 7:54 i.e. ‘The laws of Nature’ laid down by Him cannot be violated, but if He wills He can, as He does in the case of miracles which He Himself makes His Prophets (PBT) to perform.
