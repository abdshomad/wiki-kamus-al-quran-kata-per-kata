35. KHATA MA (He has set a seal) 2:7 (م ت خ)

A seal neither allows anything to go in nor anything to come out. Seals are set on the hearts/minds, and hearings of the infidels and there is a covering over their eyes, as a result of this they do not receive any religious information contained in the Quran, consequently they do not respond and thus reject it, the result of which is punishment 2:7. 

On the day of judgment Allah (S WT) will seal the mouths of such criminals and will make their hands speak and their feet give evidence of the evil they did 36:65. In paradise people will be given a pure drink sealed with musk. We are ordered to put an effort to achieve it 83:25-26. Muhammed (PBH) is the seal of prophet hood (Khaatam-an-Nabiyyiin) 33:40. This means that no new messenger or message of Allah will come after him. The Quran is thus the final communication of Allah, a ‘Seal’ on the Divine messages in which no falsehood can enter and from which nothing can be removed 15:9, 18:27, 41:42.
