27. YUNFIQUUN (They Spend) 2:3 (ق ف ن)

Infaq means ‘spending’ not charity and this is done through what Allah (SWT) has provided 2:3 because we own nothing, everything belongs to Him 14:2, we are just custodians of His provisions and we have to obey His orders while spending: As spending does not always mean charity, it could be for a good cause or a bad cause. Spending could be on wordly items like agriculture 18;42, family 4:34, divorced women 65:6-7 and in the path of Allah (SWT) 2:262. We are to spend on parents, relatives, orphans, needy, wayfarers etc. 2:215 that which is good 2:267, in excess of our essential needs 2:219 and that which we love 3:92 (for instance wealth). We may hide and spend or spend openly 13:22, we should neither be extravagant nor niggardly 25:67. We should spend in prosperity and adversity 3:134, day and night 2:274, willingly 2:184 seeking Allah’s (SWT) attention for our own good 2:272. That which we spend in the way of Allah (SWT) will be paid back to us 8:60. We should not spend bad things 2:267, should not stress our obligation on, should not annoy those on whom we spend and we should not spend to show people 2:264. We should no t spend on stopping people from Allah’s (SWT) path 8:36, and we should not spend unwillingly 9:54. Items associated with ‘Infaaq’ i.e. spending are salat 2:3 patience, truth, obedience 3:17 good 2:267 and 272, righteousness 3:92, bad 2:267, show off 4:38, willingness and unwillingness 9:53. The opposites of ‘Infaaq’ are hoarding 9:34, and holding back i.e. not spending 17:100.
