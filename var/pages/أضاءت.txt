69. AZAAA–‘AT (It enlightened) 2:17 (ء و ض)

Other derivative: - ‘Light’ due to which we are able to see the material world:- (1) Light from lightening 2:20. (2) Light from the sun 10.5, in both the cases the light is associated with heat. The opposites of this light are darkness 2:20 and night 28:71. 

The word ‘ziyaaa’ meaning ‘light’ is used for the Tawraah which differentiated between the right and the wrong and it was a reminder for those who guarded against evil 21:48. It has also been stated to be ‘Nuur’ 5:44,46. The Quran has always been called ‘Nuur’ 5:15,7:157,64:8, it has never been called ‘Ziyaa’. ‘Nuur’ is pure light not associated with heat, as in the case of moon light 10:5 i. e. when heat is removed from ‘Ziyaaa’ it is known as ‘Nuur’ from which nothing can be removed. The Tawraah and the Injiil were altered 2:79 but the Quran is protected 15:9. This may be the reason for using the word Nuur for the holy Quran and ‘Ziyaaa’ for Tawraah as it exists now compared to the original one for which probably the word Nuur was used 5:44, 6:91.
