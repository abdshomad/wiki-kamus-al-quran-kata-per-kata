173. ASHAAB (Companions) 2:39 (ب ح ص)

The exact meaning conveyed through the derivatives of these alphabets is company 18:76, 31:15 and companions 56:8-9 but for those in the fire of hell and gardens of paradise 59:20 the word ‘Inhabitants’ seems to be better than ‘companions’ . These derivatives have been used to mean wife 6:101 and those who are defended 21:43 (probably by their companions).
