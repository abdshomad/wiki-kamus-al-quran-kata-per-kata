143. NUQADDISU We sanctify (you) 2:30 (س د ق)

We normally remove our shoes at sacred places to maintain the sanctity of the place. Musa (PBH) was asked to remove his shoes in the valley of Tuwa because of its being holy, sacred etc., 20:12. Musa (PBH) asked his people to enter the holy land 5:21 and warned that if they do not enter then they will turn as losers. This indicates that derivatives of   these alphabets in addition to meaning holy also mean something beneficial. It was probably due to the strengthening of Isa (PBH) with the Holy Spirit (Jibriil) that he was able to speak even in his childhood about things which were holy, exclusively good, free from evil and also highly beneficial 2:87, 5:110. The same Holy Spirit brought down the Quran 16:102, 26:193 which is again holy, exclusively good, free from evil and highly beneficial. This Holy Spirit is also known as the trust worthy spirit which indicates that there is no possibility of any contamination in something regarded as holy. The angels regard Allah (SWT) as Holy 2:30. One of the Attributes of Allah (SWT) is ‘Al Qudduus’ 62:1 which would mean One Who is pure, having nothing in Him other than Himself, free from all defects, evils etc. exhibiting unmatched beneficence.
