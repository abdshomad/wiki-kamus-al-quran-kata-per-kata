5. RABB (Fosterer) 1:1 (ب ب ر)

Rabb is someone who fosters a thing in such a manner as to make it attain one condition after another until it reaches its goal of completion (Raghib). Rabb is thus someone Who is the Owner, the Master, the Lord possessing supreme power and authority, One Who cherishes, sustains, nourishes, brings to maturity, maintains, manages, develops, evolves in short One Who fosters - The Fosterer. 

Allah (SWT) as ‘The Rabb’ is the Owner, the Master, the Cherisher, the Sustainer, the Fosterer of the whole universe 6:165, 45:36. He is the Lord possessing supreme power and authority over the throne of the universe 9:129 and does what He Wills 11:107. We have accepted Him as our Lord and Fosterer even before coming into this world 7:172-174. This is an experience we do not remember, but memory is not the basis of the truth of some event, it is a truth beyond denial that all of us were born but we do not remember the most important event of our life. He as our Fosterer, created us and ordered the angels to bow down before Adam 38:71-74. Bowing down of angels was probably putting all concerned energies under the control of man. In view of this the present human progress in science and technology may be due only to their control on energies known as angels in the language of religion and this human control on energies is a gift to humanity by Allah (SWT) and not its achievement. Allah (SWT) as the Fosterer provides for mankind whatever He Wills giving more to some and less to others 17:30. He guides human beings through His communications to selected persons known as prophets and messengers of Allah (SWT) who try to lead them to paradise and save them from hell 4:163-166, 7:203. We are required to seek only His help 1:4, 40:60 as He is our Fosterer 114:1, praise and glorify Him 32:15, declare His Greatness 2:185, believe in His sign s, fear Him, not associating any partner with Him 23:57-61, put our trust only in Him 16:99 and worship Him alone 40:64-65 seeking His protection from being influenced by the evil suggestions of the devil 23:97-98 because if we obey the devil we will land in hell 26:91-95. Allah (SWT) operates as Rabb exhibiting 30 of His Attributes. Some communities regard their priests, monks and prophets as their Rabb 9:31, 3:64. The fact is that Allah (SWT) is the only Rabb-Fosterer of His creation 1:1.
