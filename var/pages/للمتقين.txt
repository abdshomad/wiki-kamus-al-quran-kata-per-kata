21. LIL MUTTAQIIN For those who guard (against evil) 2:2 (ى ق و)
 
Derivatives of the same root alphabets convey the sense of physical protection 16:81, safety from physical torture 66:6, safety from selfishness 59:9, being careful 3:28, restraint from doing something 2:179, fearing Allah (SWT) 2:196 etc. 

Muttaqiin are therefore those persons who guard themselves against all evils due to fear of Allah because He is All-Powerful to punish them. This feeling of restraint is known as ‘Taqwaa’ 2:197. 

‘Taqwaa’ is associated with the following good qualities: belief 2:103, Quran 69:48, obeying Allah (SWT) and His messenger (PBH) and the consequent success 24:52, submission and salat 6:71-72, doing good 3:172, amending 7:35, giving charity and accepting that which is good 92:5-7, justice 5:8, righteousness 5:2, forgiveness 74:56, patience 3:120, fear of hell 39:16 pleasing Allah 9:109 etc. 

Things which oppose ‘Taqwaa’ are sin 2:206, 38:28, infidelity 13:35 etc. ‘Taqwaa’ resides in the hearts 49:3 and this feeling should generate good deeds:2:2-5, 2:177, 3:133-135, 9:44, 39:33 etc. 
 
Allah (SWT) orders us to fear Him 3:102, 64:16. When Muttaqiin are disturbed by the evil suggestions of the devil they remember Allah (SWT) then they see aright 7:201. 

The benefits of Taqwaa are that one is given the power of distinction between right and wrong, evils are wiped off and forgiven 8:29, his affair is made easy 65:4, he is blessed from the sky and the earth 7:96. Allah (SWT) is with the Muttaqiin 16:128, 3:76 and they are the most honored 49:13 finally their destination is paradise 52:17-18.
