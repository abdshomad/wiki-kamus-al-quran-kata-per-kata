Sirât ?????

A path which is even, wide enough and can be trodden without difficulty; Way that is straight so that all parts of it are in orderly array and are properly adjusted to one another. The Arabs did not regard a way as Sirât until it comprises the following five prominent features: 1) Rectitude. 2) Leading surely to the objective. 3) Being the shortest. 4) Being broad in width for travellers. 5) To determine as the road to the goal in the eyes of the wayfarers. It is also written with Sîn. (L; T; R; LL).

Sirâtun/Sirâtan??????? / ?????? (acc./nom.n.): Right path. The word has been used in the Holy Qur’ân about 45 times.
