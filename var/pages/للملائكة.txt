138. AL-MALAAA-IK (Angels) 2:30 (ك ل م)

Angels reside in the sky and are sent down to earth 53:26, 17:95 executing various orders of Allah (SWT) as His servants 43:19. There are numerous angels and they bow down before Allah fearing Him (SWT) 16:49, glorifying and praising Him 2:30, 13:13 bearing witness of His unity that there is no god except Him 3:18. They are capable of receiving information, knowledge and communication from Allah (SWT) and conveying His messages to human beings selected by Him, in this sense they too are messengers of Allah (SWT) like human being 2:30 and 2:32,  8:12, 22:75, 35:1 etc. Such messengers were sent to Zakariyya (PBH) 3:39, Maryam (PBH) 3:42-45, Ibrahim (PBH) 15:53 Lut (PBH) 11:81 etc. 

Angels can be transformed to appear like human beings as in the case of Ibrahiim (PBH) and Lut (PBH) 11:69-83, 6:9. Human beings too  can be transformed into angels, if Allah (SWT) wills 43:60. Angels are associated with Jibriil (PBH) ‘The Ruuh’ and come down with him with the messages of Allah (SWT) 16:2 and also during Lailat-ul-Qadr (27th Ramadan) for all affairs 97:4. Derivatives of the root alphabets also mean power 7:188, control 23:88, mast er or owner 3:26, king 12:43 etc. In view of these meanings the word ‘Malaaaik’ translated as ‘Angels’ could also mean ‘Energies’ or ‘Power’. Angels were ordered to bow down before Adam (PBH) but Iblis was questioned for his not bowing down 7:11-12 although he is a jinn, 18:50. This indicates that the word Malaaaik, at least here, conveys the meaning of energies because Iblis is not an angel, still he was included in the order. All energies in the form of angels bowed down before Adam (PBH) except the evil energy in the form of the devil or Iblis. 

The sole reason for the scientific and technological progress of man control on various energies. If this control on energies granted by Allah (SWT) by making all angels (energies) to bow down before Adam (PBH) or man is withdrawn by Him, the whole building of Scientific and Technological progress would collapse and probably the whole human race would perish. 

Angels praise, glorify obey the orders of and bow down before Allah (SWT) out of reverence for Him which He alone deserves. Their bowing down before man cannot therefore be due to reverence, it could just mean their exhibition of obeying the orders of Allah (SWT) to come under the control of man in the form of various energies so that he could use them for his advancement, their does not appear to be any other concrete reason for the angels to bow down before man in addition to their bowing down before Allah (SWT). This indicates that the whole scientific and technological progress of man is the gift of Allah (SWT) and not his achievement, his achievement would be to bring under control the evil energy of the devil which refused to surrender before him because this is the only way he can enter paradise. On the contrary many men have surrendered to the devil who will lead them to hell. Angels have the capability of lifting weight 2:248 which again hints that they possess energy. They record human deeds 50:17-18, 82:10-11, protect and monitor them 13:11, ask for protective forgiveness of those on earth 42:5, shower mercy on the believer 33:43, descend on them with good news 41:30-32, help 3:125 and influence them 8:12. They shower mercy on prophet Muhammed (PBH) 33:56. They curse and punish the infields 2:161, 8:12 and bring about disaster 15:63. They cause to die  32:11, 16:32, 8:50. 

They ascend towards Allah (SWT) in a period which is 50,000 years 70:4 and will come down with Him on the day of resurrection to stand in ranks along with Jibriil (PBT) 78:38. On the day of judgment they will  be around the throne of Allah (SWT) glorifying and praising Him 69:16-18, 39:75, they will console the believers 21:103 and welcome them to paradise 13:23-24, 39:73. Many angels are in charge of hell too 39:71-72, 66:6, 74:31. We are required to believe in their existence and functions given in the Quran 2:285. 

The Quran gives information about the functions or duties of angels but does not give any information about their form and the substance from which they were create d. Hazrat Aysha (R.A.) quotes the prophet (PBH) as saying, “Angels have been created from Nuur” [Reported by Muslim]. 

Angels could therefore be regarded as beings composed of some form of radiant energy or ‘Incharges’ of various energies in the universe whom we cannot perceive through our physical sense but who exert their influence on us without our being conscious of it, just like x-rays which penetrate the human flesh but do not impart any feeling to the human being concerned. Angels are thus beings the effect of whose work is visible but they themselves are not visible.
