7. MAALIK (Master) 1:3 (ك ل م)
 
An Attribute of Allah (SWT) meaning One Who owns having full authority and power 30:28 on everything - the Master. ‘Malik’ meaning ‘King’ 23:116 and ‘Mulk’ meaning kingdom 3:189 are from the same root alphabets. In the kingdom of Allah (SWT) all others are slaves having only those powers which are bestowed by Him. No one has any power or authority on his own accord. He is the Real King (20:114)
