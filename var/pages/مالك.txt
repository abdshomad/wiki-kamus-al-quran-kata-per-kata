7. MAALIK (Master) 1:3 (ك ل م)
 
An Attribute of Allah (SWT) meaning One Who owns having full authority and power 30:28 on everything - the Master. ‘Malik’ meaning ‘King’ 23:116 and ‘Mulk’ meaning kingdom 3:189 are from the same root alphabets. In the kingdom of Allah (SWT) all others are slaves having only those powers which are bestowed by Him. No one has any power or authority on his own accord. He is the Real King (20:114)

Malaka ?????? ??????????????? To possess, become the owner of, conquer, have control, rule, take a wife, have power, reign, be capable of, able to obtain, can do, can avail, have authority, hold. Mallak ?????: To transfer property, give to anyone the possession, give a support to. Milâk ???: Marriage. Amlakâhu ?????: They gave him in marriage. Mâlik ???? and Malik ??? are two different words from the same root. The former signifies master and the latter king. According to the rule of forming derivation in Arabic an additional letter (as Alif in Mâlik ????) gives the meanings of intensity, thus a master or lord is more than a king. The use of the word Mâlik ????, Master or Lord in verse 1:4 is to show that Allâh is not guilty of injustice if he forgives his servants because he is not a King or a Judge but more properly a Master. Being Master He can forgive and show mercy wherever and in whatever manner he may like. Its root is ??? or ????
