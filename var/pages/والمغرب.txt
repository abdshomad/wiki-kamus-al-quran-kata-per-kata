370. AL MAGRIB (The West) 2:115 (ب ر غ)

These words are normally translated as the east and the west respectively. An associated word ‘Ash raqa’ means to shine or light up (39:69). At dawn the environment is illuminated by the sun, this direction is therefore known as Mash riq i.e. the east. The word ‘Gharabiyb’ means extremely blac k (35:27) and the word ‘Ghurub’ means to set (50:39). The direction in which the sun sets and thus gives rise to darkness is known as Maghrib i.e. the west. The words Mashriq, Maghrib, Masjid etc. convey the sens e of place as well as time. Mashriq and Maghrib have been used as singulars meaning east and we st (2:258), as duals ‘Mashriqain’ and ‘Maghriba in’ (55:17) probably refer to the two extreme positions of the sun on 22nd December and 22nd June every year known as the winter solstice and summer solstice respectively. The plurals Mashaariq and Maghaarib (70:40) have also been used. The earth is continuously rotating therefore every moment at some place or the other on the earth, the sun appe ars to be either rising or setting, giving rise to innumerable places and times of sun rise and sun set. This phenomena refers to the whole earth. Even if we consider a single place on earth say Hyderabad in India, the place and time of sun rise and sun set change daily. But on any particular day at a particular place the sun rise and sun set have always take n place at a fixed time. On 11th October 1996 the sun rise and sun se t at Hyderabad took place at 6.09 A.M. and 5.57 P.M. Any year, wh ether in past or future, the sun rise and sun set at Hyderabad was/would be at the timings indicated above. It is stated in the Quran ‘.............. Allah measures out (yuqaddiruu) the night and the day........’ (73:20). This natural phenomena of alternation of day and night demonstrates the precision of ‘Taqdir’ i.e. destiny destined by Allah (SWT).
