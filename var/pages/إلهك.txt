397. ILAAHA (God) 2:133 (ﻩ ل ا)

The word Ilaaha is translated as ‘God’. It is not a personal name like ‘Allah’ but the name of a status or a designation like president, chairman, king etc. Ilaaha is the Supreme Head of the whole creation and there was, is and will be only One Ilaaha i.e. Allah (SWT) 2:163, 47:19. If there were two or more gods or supreme authorities then there would have been disorder in the whole universe due to their fighting for achieving the ownership or control of the throne of the universe and each god would have taken away things which he had created 17:42, 23:91. On the contrary we find perfect order in the whole universe which proves that there is only One Go d i.e. Allah (SWT). Whatever is there other than Him is His creation and nothing from His creation should be considered as ‘God’. In fact the whole creation has been put into service of man by Allah (S WT) 45:13, therefore regarding someone other than Allah (SWT) as ‘God’ is similar to worshipping your own servants. Is it not ridiculous? ‘Ilaaha’ is One Who creates, He Himself is not created 112:1-4. He can benefit or harm anyone, He controls death and life 25:3. Nothing else can do these things. 

Things which have been wrongly considered as Ilaaha are (1) Idols 6:74, (2) Human beings 5:116, 9:31, (3) Angels and Jinn 34:40-41. Considering any other person or thing besides Allah (SWT) as Ilaaha is an unforgivable sin 4:48.
