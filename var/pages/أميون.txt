300. UMMIYYUUN (Unlettered)  2:78 (م م ا)

The first set of derivatives of these alphabets conveys the meanings of mother 7:150, mother (of cities) 6:92, original 13:39, capital (of a town) 28:59 and basis 3:7. The second set communicates the meanings of community 2:128 and species 6:38. The third set conveys the sense of leader 2:124, open or leading road 15:79, guide 36:12 and limit 75:5. 

One of the derivatives of the fourth set is ‘ummiyuun’ normally translated as the unlettered. These ummiyyuun were those who did not follow any religious book, their religion was hearsay based on guess work 2:78. Opposed to this there was another group of people who were addressed by prophet Muhammed (PBH), they were those who were given a book i.e. the Jews and the Christians 3:20 who used to say that  there was no responsibility on them regarding the ummiyyuun 3:75 i.e. people who were not following any Di vine book before the Holy Quran was revealed. Prophet Muhammed (PBH) was raised as a messenger from this group of ummiyyuun 62:2 and called Nabbiyyal-ummiyy 7:157 but was a messenger of Allah (SWT) to the whole of mankind including the Jews and the Christians 7:157-158. Before the revelation of the Holy Quran prophet Muhammed (PBH) did not know reading or writing, had he known reading and writing then some people would have thought that the Quran was written by him i.e. they would have doubted its Divine origin 29:48. 

The Holy Quran is a treasure of true and useful knowledge, then how can a person to whom this great book was revealed be considered as unlettered? In fact after the completion of the revelation of the Quran he should be considered the most learned human being who was basically selected to guide and lead the human species to paradise.
