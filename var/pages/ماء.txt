101. MAA-A (Water) 2:22 (ﻩ و م)

The rain that comes down from the clouds in the sky giving life to the dead earth 2:164 through which grows the vegetation providing food 6:99, 16:10, 14:32. This rain water actually belongs to the earth 11:44, 79:31 having evaporated from it to form clouds 15:22. It is clean 25:48 and comes down in a measured amount with a set programme 23:18, 43:11 and later on flows in the form of rivers 13:17 and comes out from porous rocks 2:74. It is used for drinking and irrigation 16:10. All living beings 21:30, 24:45 including man 25:54 have been created from water. 

The word ‘Maaa’ has been used for seminal fluid 32:8, 77:20, 86:6. It has also been used for water like molten brass which will be given to the inmates of hell 18:29 which would obviously be at very high temperature. The inmates of hell will get boiling water for drinking 14:16, whereas in paradise there will be rivers of unpolluted water 47:15, 56:31. 

The seminal fluid and molten brass are not water i.e. the word ‘Maaa’, meaning water in general is also used for liquids of different composition and at very high temperatures. 

It is stated in the Quran. “And He (Allah) it is Who created the skies and the earth in six periods when His throne was on water............” 11:7. 

In view of the above discussion, if the ‘throne’ is understood to mean ‘control’ then does the word ‘Maaa’ mean ordinary water or a fluid at very high temperature? Does this refer to the super dense nuclear fluid of the primeval atom before the ‘Big Bang’ marking the explosive initiation of the present universe 21:30?
