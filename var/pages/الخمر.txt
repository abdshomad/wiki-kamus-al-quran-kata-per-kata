498. AL KHAMR (Intoxicants) 2:219 (ر م خ)

One derivative of these alphabets is used to mean ‘head cover used by women which completely covers them’ 24:31. It is probably used to mean wine 47:15 because that also influences a person from head to foot. Intoxicants are associated with games of chance and are prohibited 5:90-91.
