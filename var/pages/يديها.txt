271. YADAYHAA (In front of them)  2:66 (ى د ى)

When derivatives of these alphabets are prefixed with the word ‘Bayna’ the combination conveys the sense of ‘in front of their hands’ because‘Aydiihim’ means ‘their hands’. In other words this combination means ‘in front of’ or ‘before’ 7:57 the opposite of which is ‘behind’ 2:255. Few derivatives convey the sense of ‘what you have earned’ although the statement is ‘what your hands have earned’ 30:41, where hands represent the person to whom the hands belong. In some cases hands represent power 3:73, control 36:83, 2:237 strength 38:45, restraining or stretching hands for spending 17:29 etc.
