902. JANNA (It covered) 6:76 (ن ن ج)

Something hidden 53:32

The Jinn (6:100) were created before man from heat wave 15:27 which radiates from fire 55:15 (probably infra-red rays). The substance of their creation is not visible, therefore they too are invisible. Iblis 18:50 belongs to the category of devils 6:112 and probably influence the psychical personalities of human being through their instigation's 114:4-6. The Jinn along with the human beings were created to serve (worship) Allah (SWT) 51:56. The Jinn listened to the Holy Quran and acted as messengers communicating the message of the Holy Quran to their community 46:29-32, 6:130, 72:1. There are good as well as bad Jinn 72:11, 14-15. The bad Jinn are probably the devils misleading the human beings and even making them worship them 34:41 and thus winning over many human beings to their side. Human beings too sought these devils and followed evil desires but blamed the devils for all their sins 6:128, 41:29, 72:6. The result is that all the misleaders and those misled will be punished 6:128. The Jinn appear to be residents of the earth capable of moving towards the sky to hear secrets but a flame drives them away 72:8-9, 15:17-18, 37:7-10. They along with the human beings are challenged to cross the boundaries of the skies and the earth and are warned that flames and smoke will be sent on them 55:33-35. They worked for Sulaiman (PBH) being capable of lifting weights and doing civil engineering works 27:17, 39; 34:13. This indicates that they too are energies. The Jinn cannot produce anything like the Quran 17:88. They do not know the unseen 34:14. They are liable to be questioned for their sins like the human beings 55:39. They too appear to have weight like human beings 5:46. They appear to have relationships with females as men have 55:56. The bad among them will be punished in hell 7:38, 179. It is indicated that the good among them will rejoice in paradise 55:44-47. The Jinn are capable of hearing, seeing, working, listening to the Holy Quran, communicating messages, doing righteous work, committing sins, residing in the earth, rising towards the sky, not knowing the unseen, being punished in hell and rejoicing in paradise, possessing weight, who have been created to serve Allah (SWT). They differ from human beings having been created from fire and invisible to the human eye. They probably interact with human beings through the psychical personalities of the latter.
