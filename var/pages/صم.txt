75. SUMMUM (Deaf) 2:18 (م م ص)

The brain receives signals from the external world through the five physical senses and responds accordingly. If someone cannot or does not hear or listen to them he cannot respond, this is the case with those who do not listen to the message of Allah (SWT) 5:71 and deny it 6:39. Due to this arrogance of not listening they neither return to the right path 2:18 nor do they understand 2:171 therefore they are classed as the worst of  creatures 8:22. 

Such deafness to the message of Allah (SWT) is associated with dumbness and blindness 2:171. i.e. they can neither see nor respond. The opposite of deafness is hearing 11:24. The dead do not hear 27:80 and also those in the graves 35:22. Those whom Allah (SWT) leaves in error will be gathered on the day of resurrection blind, dumb and deaf and their settling place will be hell 17:97.
