650. NUUHIIHI (We communicate it) 3:44 (ى ح و)

The word ‘Wahi’ is translated as ‘Communication’ 53:4. Allah (SWT) directly communicates with man or speaks from behind a veil or sends messengers (angels) who communicates to human beings by His permission 42:51. The first method was probably followed with Nuuh (PBH) when he was ordered to build a ship in accordance with the communication of Allah (SWT) 11:37, the second method was adopted with Musa (PBH) when Allah (SWT) spoke to him from behind a veil 20:13 and an example of the third method is the announcement of angels to Zakariyya (PBH) regarding the birth of a son Yahya (PBH) 3:39. Through these 3 methods Allah (SWT) communicate with His messengers among human beings 4:163-166, 14:13. The Quran was communicated to prophet Muhammed (PBH) 6:19, 12:3 in Arabic language 42:7 through the Ruuh i.e. Jibriil (PBH) 42:52 and if Allah (SWT) wills He can take it back 17:86-87. Allah (SWT) communicates with angels 8:12, He communicated to the disciples of Isa (PBH) 5:111-115, and the mother of Musa (PBH) 20:38, 28:7. Allah (SWT) communicated to the bee probably through its instinct 16:68, He communicated to each sky its affair, probably following laws of nature 41:12 He will communicate to the earth probably inspiring her to tell her news on the day of resurrection 99:4-5. Allah (SWT) communicates the unseen 3:44.

The word ‘Wahi’ has also been used for Zakariyya (PBH) when he communicated to his people (probably by signs) to glorify Allah (SWT) 19:11. It is stated that the devils communicate to their friends to dispute with the messenger (PBH) of Allah (SWT) 6:121, probably by instigating evil. 

The word ‘Wahi’ translated as ‘communication’ also appears to refer to inspiration, signs, instinct, laws of nature, instigation etc. At many places in the Quran, the derivatives of these alphabets (Wahi) are associated with the word ‘Fosterer’ which indicates that communicating orders to the creation is part of ‘Fostering the creation’ by the Fosterer i.e. Allah (SWT).
