33. SAWAAA – UN (Equal) 2:6 (ى و س)

Extracts of some verses of the Quran in which derivatives of the same root alphabets are used are given below to show the similarity in the meanings they convey: “The rich do not give away their provision to their slaves so that they may become equal (Sawaaa-’un) to them” 16:71. “Is the blind man equal (yastawi) to one who sees?” 13:16. “He saw him in the middle of hell”. 37:55. “Infidels will wish that they were leveled (tusawwa) with the ground” 4:42. ‘Saaw aa’ is used for leveling the space between two mountains”. 18:96. ‘Astawa’ is used for balancing on the ship 23:28 and ‘tastawuu’ is used for balancing on cattle back while riding 43:12-13. ‘Sawwiya’ is used for putting fingers in order 75:4. 

These derivatives convey the meaning of: equal, middle, level, balance, order etc. Something in the middle is equidistant from the borders; something leveled is equal in height, something in balance or in order is in equilibrium. Thus all these derivatives convey somewhat similar meanings. In view of this the derivative ‘Astawaa’ used in various verses of the Quran referring to the skies and the earth would mean setting up the balance or or der or equilibrium 2:29, 7:54, 79:28 after the chaos of the ‘Big Bang’ which marks the birth of the present universe.
