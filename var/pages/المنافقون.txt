1606. AL-MUNAAFIQUUN (The Hypocrites) 63:1 (ق ف ن)

Hypocrites are those who say that which is not in their hearts, they are nearer to infidelity than belief 3:167, they are liers 59:11. Hypocrisy was put in their hearts because they went against their promise with Allah (SWT) and they lied 9:77. They enjoin that which is not recognized as good and stop people from recognized good, withholding their hands, they forget Allah (SWT) and are transgressors 9:67, the opposite behavior is of the believers 9:71. They like that believers should also behave like them, believers are therefore ordered not to take them in friendship 4:89. They stand up for salat as if loaded with a burden just to show to people and do not remember Allah (SWT) much 4:142. The hypocrites will be punished three times probably in this world, in the graves after death and before resurrection and in the hereafter 9:101 (This verse is usually referred to in support of the punishment in graves)
