4. Al-HAMD (The praise) 1:1 (دم ح)	ُﺪْﻤَﺤﻟَا


It is very clearly hinted in the Holy Quran 3:188 that He only should be praised who does something good. It is Allah (SWT) Who does everything therefore, all praise is due only to Him 1:1. ‘Al’ translated as ‘the’ also conveys the sense of ‘all’ . Allah (SWT) initiated the creation of the universe 35:1, 2:117. He fosters it and everything in it belongs to Him 34:1 therefore everything praises Him 17:44. 

Al-Hamd, at some places in the Holy Quran conveys the sense of ‘thanks’ 7:43, 14:39, 23:28 and 27:15. All thanks are also due only to Him because He does everything for us . Those who do not thank Him by praising Him exhibit ingratitude and pride 31:12, 32:15. Allah (SWT) does not like these qualities in His servants 39:7, on the contrary He orders:

“Put your trust in the Living Who does not die and glorify (Him) by praising Him (thanking Him) ... 25:58 

Other words associated with ‘Hamd’ are the Attributes of Allah (SWT)Al-Hamiid 2:267 meaning Praiseworthy, Ahmad 61:6 and Muhammed (PBH) 3:144 the names of the last messenger of Allah (SWT) meaning one who is praised, Mahmuud 17:79 meaning praised.
