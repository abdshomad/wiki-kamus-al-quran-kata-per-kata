695. FAL-YATA-WAKKAL Then let them put their trust (in Allah) 3:122 (ل ك و)

Other derivatives: Entrusted with or put in charge of 32:11, to trust someone 9:129. Derivatives are associated with belief 5:23 and Islam 10:84. Opposite sense is conveyed by the word infidelity 6:89. 

One of the Attributes of Allah (SWT) is Al Wakiil meaning the Trustee 6:102. Allah (SWT) loves those who put their trust in Him 3:159 and whoever puts his trust in Him, then He is sufficient for him 65:3. 

It is reported by Anas (R.A) that our Prophet (PBH) had said “Trust in Allah but tie your camel” (Tirmezi). This indicates that we should put our full efforts and then leave the result to Allah (SWT) also hinted in 6:102 where the order to serve Allah (SWT) precedes the statement that He is the Trustee over everything.
