638. NUUH (PBH) (Noah) 3:33

Nuuh (PBH): name of a prophet who was sent to his people to warn them that they should worship only Allah (SWT) fearing Him and they should obey him. He tried all meth ods of inviting his people towards Allah (SWT) but they disobeyed him and got involved in idol worship, therefore those who disobeyed him were drowned 71:1-28. Earlier Nuuh (PBH) was asked to build a ship in accordance with the communications of Allah (SWT) 11:37. This was probably the first invention of mankind but under Divine guidance. Are all ot her inventions too under Divine guidance? 

When the water gushed forth Nuuh (PBH) was asked to take in his ship two of each pair, his people and the believers 11:40 after the water receded the ship rested on Mount Judi 11:44. The son of Nuuh (PBH) was not saved from drowning 11:42- 46 and Nuuh’s (PBH) wife did not believe 66:10. This shows that belief and consequent deeds have nothing to do with relationship. Nuuh (PBH) lived for 950 years 29:14.
