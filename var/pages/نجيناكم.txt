200. NAJJAYNAAKUM (We delivered you) 2:49 (ى ج ن)

Other derivatives: Being safe 12:45, safety from punishment 11:58, 44:30, delivery from danger 23:28, from distress 20:40, 37:76, from fire 29:24, from drowning 2:50, from enemy 20:80, from unjust people 28:25. Allah (SWT) delivers us from every distress 6:64, He has made it incumbent on Himself to deliver the believers i.e. keep them safe 10:103. Few derivatives are used to mean secret consultations 58:12 (probably because these secret talks are held at places and times when they are safe from other people hearing them). Secret talks should not be held for sin, transgression and disobedience to the messenger of Allah (SWT), but they should be held for righteousness and guarding against evil 58:9, enjoining charity, good and reconciliation between people seeking Allah’s (SWT) pleasure, such an act has a great reward 4:114. There is no secret talk but Allah (SWT) is with them wherever they are and on the day of resurrection He will inform them of that which they did, He knows everything 58:7 such talks are associated with secrecy 21:3 and hiding 9:78.
