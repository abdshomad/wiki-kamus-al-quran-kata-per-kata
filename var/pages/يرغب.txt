Other derivatives: Turning one’s attention towards 94:8, preferring 9:120, hoping 21:90 desiring 4:127, seeking 9:59 etc, but when these derivatives are followed by the preposition ‘An’ they give the opposite meaning of forsaking 19:46, instead of seeking. The hope or expectation is associated with fear 21:90.
