641. AR RAJIIM (The outcast) 3:36 (م ج ر)

Also translated as accursed 16:98 and driven away 15:17. The basic sense conveyed through derivatives of these alphabets is throwing stones at someone 11:91 due to which one is driven away. Missile 67:5 (too are shot at) and guess 18:22 (amounts to throwing ideas.)
