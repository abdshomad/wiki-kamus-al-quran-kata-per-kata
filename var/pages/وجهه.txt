364. WAJ-HAHUU (Himself) 2:112 (ﻩ ج و) 

Other derivatives: Face 12:93. If someone calls us we normally turn our face in his direction, few derivatives have been used to convey the sense of attention 12:9. Face being in front, it appears first, in this sense at one place these derivatives are used to mean morning compared to evening 3:72 as morning appear s first. Face is the basis for recognizing someone as a person, therefore some derivatives have been used to mean the person as a whole 2:112. They are also used to convey the sense of direction towards which one turns his face 16:76. They are also used to mean honour 33:69 as a person who is honoured is recognized by his face. In the life in the hereafter too faces have been mentioned 80:38-41. 

It is stated that, in which ever direction one turns the ‘Wajhu’ i.e. the Face or Person or Attention of Allah (SWT) is there 2:115. This may mean that Allah (SWT) concentrates or pays His Attention to everything, everywhere all the time, contrary to this we can concentrate on only one thing at a time.
