La ? Prefix: An affirmative intensifying particle, used as a corroborative, when written or pronounced with fathah it means "verily", "surely", "indeed", "certainly", "truly", "by" (an particle of oath), a preposition denoting possession, as lî????, lanâ ???, laka ???, lahû ??, lakum ???: To me, us, thee, him, you. It is also used as preposition expressing attribution, design, as al-Majdu lillahi ??????: Glory be to God. Laka alamru ???????: It is to thee to decide the affair. It denotes both the genitive and dative cases meaning: "to", "for", "unto", "on account of", "in order to", "belonging to", as ’Alâ ???? expresses the condition of a debtor, so does Li ?? that of a creditor, thus Li’alaihi????????: He owes me. When prefixed to the aorist conditional it gives it the force of an imperative. When immediately following Wâw ?? and Fâ ? it is generally written with a jazm and with a fathah when preceding any of the affixed pronouns, as Laka ???, Lanâ ????, Lahû ??. The affix of the first person singular is an exception to this rule, Li being written with a kasrah. La is with fathah when preceding the article al, then it causes the later to drop its Alif or Hamzah. Li is with Kasrah to indicate the possession (Milkiyyah ?????), deserving (Istihqâq ???????), "because of", "for the purpose of", "to become", "let do" (of imperative), as a substitute for Ilâ ????"to", as a substitute for Fî ??? "in", "for", as a substitute for ‘Alâ ???? "on", as a substitute for ’An ?? "of", "about". Lâm of emphasis and lâm al- Taukîd????????????has nothing to do with Li. This Lâm is with Kasrah, which means "in order to "or" that he may". The former is vocalized with Fathah and the latter with Kasrah. The particle Li denotes purpose, result, consequence, end, as it is said, Lidû lil maute wahnû lil kharâbî: Bear children that they should die and build houses that they should fall into ruin. The significance is not that you should bear children for death, or you should build houses to destroy them, but it denotes the end and result of such an action. Such Lâm is called Lâm ‘âqbat ?????????also denotes cause, such Lâm is called Lâm Ta‘lîl????????. In Arabic a new sentence never begins with a particle, a sentence or clause or expression must be taken as understood for that ellipse, as before 106:1. It is also used as correlative of an oath particle, as in 12:91, and as an particle of oath, as in 15:72, and introducing a conditional particle, as in 59:12, and for the purpose if it occurs after Kâna ???, preceded by negative particle, as in 3:179, and as a lâm of imperative, to mean "let do", to use the verb in a transitive sense, as in 37:103, to use as a command or order as in 24:58 and 59.
