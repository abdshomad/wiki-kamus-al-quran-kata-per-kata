178. RAHABA (To fear) 2:40 (ب ﻩ ر)

Following verse of the Quran explains one of the derivatives of these alphabets. 

“And be prepared for (fighting with) them (i.e. the infidels) with whatever force you can muster and with companies of horses (cavalry) to frighten (Turhibuun) thereby the enemy of Allah and your enemy .............” 8:60. The magicians called by Firawn sought to frighten the people 7:116, Monks 9:34 practicing monasticism 57:27 (i.e. living in seclusion probably beings afraid that they will get involved in worldly life). Fear appears to be the inherent meaning in all the derivatives. We should fear only Allah (SWT) 16:51.
