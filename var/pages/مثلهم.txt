66. MASALUHUM (Their Likeness) 2:17 (ل ث م)

Other derivatives: - Similarity 2:113, like manner 2:137, being alike 2:228, 2:275, similitude 16:60, best, exemplary 20:104 and for an example referring to Isa (PBH) 43:57 and 59. These derivatives have also been used to mean twice which actually contains two similar parts 3:13, equivalent when both the compared parts are similar 4:11 and for making Jibriil (PBH) appear like a man 19:17 probably conveying the sense of external appearance as in the case of idols referred to as  ‘Tamaasiil’ 21:52 wherein there is an external resemblance to some real object or an imaginary figure. These examples, likenesses, similitude's etc. are real not imaginary because the Quran contains only truth and nothing else.
