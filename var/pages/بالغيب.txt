23. AL GAYB (The Unseen) 2:3 (ب ى غ)

The opposite of which is ‘seen’, Allah (SWT) has knowledge of both 6:73. All the items of belief, except the Quran, are unseen at present. Remote past 11:49 and future 7:188 too are unseen. 

All those things which are existing at present but hidden from our view or comprehension are also classed as ‘Gayb’ i.e. ‘unseen’. 12:52. This word also conveys the sense of absence 27:20, 82:16.
