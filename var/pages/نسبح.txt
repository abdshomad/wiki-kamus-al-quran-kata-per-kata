142. NUSABBIH (We glorify)  2:30 (ح ب س)

Derivatives of these alphabets convey the sense of constantly moving fast in an orbit (like the sun and the moon) 21:33, prolonged occupation i.e. being busy continuously 73:7. Glorification i.e. considering Allah (SWT) high above that which they associate as partners with Him 52:43, high above having a son and high above what the polytheists describe about Him 23:91. In this sense all that is in the skies and the earth glorifies Allah (SWT) but we do not understand their glorification 17:44, 24:41. The angels too glorify 2:30 out of fear of Allah (SWT) 13:13.We are ordered to glorify the name of our Fosterer i.e. Allah 56:74 probably by repeating Subhaan Allah 12:108 and also to glorify Him by praising Him 32:15, this we are required to do specially during long hours of night 76:26. 

Glorification of Allah (SWT) is associated with prostrating before Him, remembering Him, praising Him 32:15, 20:33-34 honouring and revering Him 48:9, regarding Him Holy 2:30 asking for His protective forgiveness 42:5, Pride 7:206 and injustice 21:87 appear to be hindrances in glorification.
