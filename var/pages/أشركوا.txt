334. ASHRAKU They associated partners (with Allah (SWT). 2:96 (ك ر ش)

The Quran repeatedly states and stresses that there is only one God 2:163 and that is Allah 47:19. Whatever exists in the Universe besides Allah is His creation 25:3, 31:11, 46:4 and nothing from His creation should be considered as god or equal to 41:9 or partner 9:31, 20:32 or relative 6:101 or associate of Allah 17:111 either in personality or in attributes. One who does so is known as a polytheist (Mushrik) and the act is known as polytheism (shirk). A mushrik, instead of or in addition to Allah, worship 10:18, obeys, seeks help from 22:12, fears 4:77 etc persons and things other than Allah, The list of such objects is: Idols (22:30-31), sun and moon (41:37) animals (7:152) Jinn (6:100), devils (36:60), angels and prophets (3:80), Uzair, Isa (PBT) learned people, monks (9:30-31), evil desires (25:43), material possessions, status etc. (18:32-46), traditions (2:170) laws of nature etc. 

Polytheism is an unforgivable sin (4:48,116). These objects of worship besides Allah do not create anything while  they are themselves created, they can neither help others nor themselves, they can neither harm nor profit anyone, they are powerless (7:191-195, 10:18; 16:73-74; 22:73, 46:4-6). It is reasoned out in the Quran that if there were more than one gods each god would have taken away what he had created and some of them would have over powered others (23:91). This logical argument proves that there is only One God and this is Allah. So we are ordered to pray only to Allah (10:106). Then in ch 112:1-finish it is clearly stated that Allah is One on whom all depend, He neither begets nor is He begotten and none is like Him.
