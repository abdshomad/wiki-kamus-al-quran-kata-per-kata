111. AL HIJAARAH (The Stones) 2:24 (ر ج ح)

The derivative ‘Hujuraat’ means rooms 49:4. A room is a vacant space bounded by walls, roof and fl oor with openings like doors, windows etc. Very small holes or pores like those in a sponge can also be called very small rooms. In view of this ‘Hajar’ 2:60 and ‘Hijaarah’ 2:74 from the same root alphabets would mean porous rocks or stones. When Musa (PBH) asked for water he was asked to strike ‘Hajar’ 2:60 (meaning a porous rock or an acquifier?) out of a number of other words  for rocks available in Arabic like ‘Jab al’, ‘Rawasiya’ etc. Hearts are compared with Hijaarah 2:74 (porous rock). Hearts absorb and pump out blood, porous rocks too absorb ra in water and make it available for discharge as rivers or being drawn out from wells 2:74. One is forced to  admire the selection of the most appropriate words throughout the Quran. 

The pores prevent water from moving out easily, it is probably due to this reason that some of the derivatives are used to mean prevention (of water from getting mixed up) 25:53, prevention (from punishment) 25:22, forbidding (meaning preventing from certain things) 6:138, guardianship (which involves prevention from harm) 4:23, sense (which should prevent from falsehood) 89:5. 

Hijaaratam-min-sijjiil 11:82 and Hij aaratam-min-tiin 51:33 can be translated as porous stones of (baked) clay’. Baking involves heat. In view of this it appears that these stones were thrown out of a volcano and fell down as rain 11:82, they became porous due to loss of volatile gases. In the case of the owners of elephant 105:4, the birds might have been made to pick up these stones thrown out of a volcano and deposited earlier, there being many igneous rocks in and around Mecca. The place Al Hijr where Saleh (PBH) preached is a rocky area (probably of porous rocks) 15:80.
