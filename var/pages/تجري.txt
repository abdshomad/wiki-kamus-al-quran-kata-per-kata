117. TAJRII (Flow) 2:25 (ى ر ج)

Other derivatives: Flowing of (rivers) 2:25, sailing of (ships) 10:22, blowing of (wind) 21:81, movement of (sun and moon) 13:2, 36:38. They are also used for ships 69:11 which stand like mountain in the water 42:32, this hints at the fact that mountains too project below the surface of the earth like ships below water level. This fact of mountains having roots was discovered recently. One of the derivatives is probably used for comets or black holes 81:15-16.
