1733. ASSAMAD (One on whom all depend) 112:2 (د م ص)

This is an Attribute of Allah (SWT) explained through verse No 3 and 4 of ch.112. Allah (SWT) neither gives birth to someone nor was He born to someone. Parents love their children therefore they cannot be considered independent of this natural urge. The one born to someone also depends on parents for his birth and is therefore not independent. In this sense too Allah (SWT) is independent. Everything other than Him is His creation and nothing is equal to or like Him, which obviously means that everything depends on Him, He being Rabb, Ar Razzaq, Al Kabiir, Al Khadir, Al Wahaab etc.
