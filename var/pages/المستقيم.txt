14. AL-MUSTAQIIM (The straight) 1:6 (م و ق)

A straight line is the shortest distance between two points and in this sense ‘Mustaqiim’ could mean the shortest distance to the destination. Qistaas-il-Mustaqiim means a balance whose horizontal rod or bar is straight i.e. correct. 17:35. 

Siraat-al-Mustaqiim would therefore mean the correct path whose distance to paradise is the shortest. Allah (SWT) guides to the straight path whom He wills 10:25, those who believe 22:54 and who hold firmly to Him 3:101. Being on the straight path is worshipping or serving Allah (SWT) 36:61 i.e. implementing the Quran 14:1 whereby one enters His Mercy and Grace 4:176. Prophet Muhammed (PBH) was himself on the straight path 36:4 and he invited 23:73 and guided others towards it 42:52-53. The devil waits on the straight path to mislead human beings 7:16. We are thus required to implement the Quran in accordance with the instructions of prophet Muhammed (PBH) avoiding the trap of the devil, this summarily is being on Siraat-al-Mustaqiim leading to paradise.
