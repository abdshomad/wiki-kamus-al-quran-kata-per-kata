452. AL QURAAN (The Holy Quran) 2:185 (ء ا ر ق)

It is stated in the Quran ‘And when the Quran is recited listen to it and be silient...............’ 7:204. We can listen to something only when it is read or recited aloud. 

Derivatives of these alphabets thus convey the meaning of reading or reciting in a voice which could be heard, compared to this ‘Tilaawath’ 2:121 means reading which need not be in a loud voice. [See word No. 2:188] 

The Author of the Quran is Alla h (SWT) 27:6 and no one else can produce such a book 2:23-24, 10:37, 11:13, 17:88, 52:33-34. The Quran is preserved in a book that is protected 56:77-80 ‘Kitaabim-maknuun’ also known as Low him Mahfuuz’ 85:21-22. It was sent down by Allah (SWT) through Jibriil (PBH) on the heart of prophet Muhammed (PBH) 26:192-196, 47:2, 42:52. 28:86-87, 29:48, 6:19, 2:151. 

The revelation started during the night of Al Qadr 97:1 which is a blessed night 44:2-3 in the month of Ramadan 2:185. The original language of the Quran was Arabic 43:3. It was revealed gradually after intervals 17:106, it was not sent down all at once 25:32. Had the Quran been sent down on a mountain, it would have split asunder due to the fear of Allah (SWT) 59:21. This appears to be the reason why the Quran was not sent down on the heart of prophet Muhammed (PBH) in one single installment but was sent down in small portions during a long span of 23 years. 

The Holy Quran is also known as Zi kr-il-Hakiim 3:58, Kitaab-il- Hakiim 10:1, Kitaab-il-Mubiin 12:1, Quran-im-Mubiin 15:1, Quran-il- Aziim 15:87, Zi kr-um-Mubaarak 21:50, Quran-il-Hakiim 36:2, Quran-i- zi z- zi kr 38:1 Kitaabum Aziiz 41:41, Quraan-il-Majiid 50:1, Quraan-un Kariim 56:77. 

The Holy Quran has been protected by Allah (SWT) therefore falsehood cannot enter it 15:9, 18:27, 41:42, 75:16-19, 87:6-7. The Holy Quran is taught by Allah (SWT) 55:1-2 and He has explained everything relevant to us, through it 16:89, 12:111, 39:27-28. It is also called light 4:175 because it shows the straight path leading to paradise. The Holy Quran contains only truth 32:2-3 and there is nothing doubtful in it 2:2 It confirms that before it there were other Divine books 4:47, 5:48. 

The aims behind the revelation of the Holy Quran are :(1) Guidance of human beings 2:185 (2) bringing them out from darkness into light 14:1 (3) to make clear to mankind many things 16:44 (4) to settle differences 16:64 (5) for judgment of disputes 4:105 (6) to serve as a reminder 7:2 (7) to warn 6:19 (8) to serve as a source of admonition 2:231 (9) a source of good news to the believers 18:1-3 (10) for reflection over its subjects 38:29 etc. 

The Holy Quran is a reminder to the whole of humanity 12:104. The devils have been kept away from even hearing it 26:210-212. The Holy Quran is easy to communicate 19:97, 44:58 and remember 54:17. It is not self contradictory 4:82. The believers are required to believe in the Holy Quran 4:136. For believers it is a guide, mercy and a healing 10:57, 17:82. The sign of belief is that when it is read before believers it increases their faith 8:2 and they are not deaf and blind to it 25:73 but fall down prostrate glorifying and praising Allah (SWT) 32:15. 

Islam should be propagated through the Quran 50:45, 6:19, 5:67 one should not hide anything that is in it 2:174. The Holy Quran is to be implemented practically 6:155. Believers are ordered not to sit in the company which rejects or mocks at the Holy Quran till they shift over to some other topic 4:140, 6:68. The Quran is not to be divided into parts 15:90-91. 

The messenger (PBH) of Allah (SWT) will complain to Allah (SWT) that his people had forsaken the Quran 25:30. The protection of Allah (SWT) from the devil should be sought before reading the Quran  16:98 then it should be recited in His name 96:1. 

We are ordered to read the Quran 18:27 gradually 73:4 as much as it is easy to 73:20 The Holy Quran is to be listened to in silence 7:204 with reflection 47:24 Recitation at dawn is witnessed 17:78 There is peace of mind and heart in the remembrance of Allah (SWT) 13:28. The Jinn too had heard the Quran 72:1.
