6. AL -ALAMIIN (The worlds) 1:1 (م ل ع)

‘Aalam’ (the singular of Aalamiin) is a thing through which the knowledge of something else is obtained. ‘Alaamaat’ means land marks 16:16 and ‘Alaam’ means mountains 42:32 which are again land marks which help in obtaining knowledge of the direction of one’s destination. The whole creation is known as an ‘Aalam’ because knowledge of its Creator Allah (SWT) is obtained through it. There are many worlds, physical, mental, spiritual, past, p resent, future, human, animal etc. Besides, the world today is not what it was yesterday or what it would be tomorrow. According to scientists, the universe is continuously expanding, occupying different volumes at different moments. Quantum physicists too propose the existence of many universes. In view of all this, the creation of Allah (SWT) would best be represented by the plural ‘Aalamiin’ meaning ‘worlds’ which includes all the heavenly bodies and the earth 45:36 and all that is between them (19:65)
