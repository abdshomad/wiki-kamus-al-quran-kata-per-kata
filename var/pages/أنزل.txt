28. UNZILA (Sent Down) 2:4 (ل ز ن)

This word and other derivatives from the same root alphabets like Nazzala, Anzala, Nuzzila, Nunazzil etc. have been used for the sending down of the Quran 2:185 along with Jibriel (PBH) 2:97 also known as Ruuh-ul Amiin (the trustworthy spirit) 26:192-196 and Ruuh-ul-Qudus (the holy spirit) 16:102. The Quran is stated to be sent down as Nuuram- mubiin (clear light) 4:175. Nuur meaning light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum. 

In view of this it appears that the Quran was telecommunicated by Allah (SWT) to prophet Muhammed (P BH) through the agency of Jibriel (PBH) who being trustworthy and pure, brought it down from Lawh im-Mahfuuz 85:21-22 as it was without any falsehood entering it 17:105, 41:42, 15:9, These derivatives have also been used for the sending down of miracles 6:37, 26:4, Towraah, Injiil 3:3 book, wisdom 2:231, balance 42:17, clear proofs, guidance 2:159, angels with orders from Allah (SWT) 16:2, 65:5 and 12 and 53:13, unseen forces 9:26, devils 26:221-222, authority 7:71 peace and tranquility 3:154, 9:26, 48:4 etc. In the material world these derivatives have been used for sending down of water as rain 29:63, which gives life to the dead earth and thus provides food 45:5, 40:13, provision 42:27 and for punishment 2:59, 29:34. 

Few derivatives have been used for descending from a higher place, on the earth itself, to a lower level as in the case of alighting from a ship 23:29, coming down from fortresses 33:26, providing manna and quails to the children of Israel 20:80. 

The derivative ‘Nuzula’ is used in the sense of a gift or entertainment 3:198, 32:19, 18:107. Is it in the sense of gift that few of the derivatives are used for sending down of good referring to the Holy Quran 2:105, sending down of cattle 39:6, of clothing 7:26, of iron 57:25, and things from the treasures with Allah (SWT) 15:21. Does sending down of iron refer to the sending it down from the sun from which the earth is supposed to have originated and evolved along with other planets? Iron cannot be synthesize d on earth, therefore does this verse throw light on the origin of the earth. Manaazil is used for the stages of  the moon 10:5. 

Derivatives of ‘Nazala’, in general, indicate movement in the downward direction, ‘Yanzil’ meaning comes down or descending is opposite of ‘ya’-Ruj’ meaning goes up or ascending 57:4.
