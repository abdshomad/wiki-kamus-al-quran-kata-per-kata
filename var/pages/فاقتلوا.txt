218. QATAL (Murder)  2:54 (ل ت ق)

One who kills a believer by mistake should set free one believing slave, if the murdered person belonged to a party with whom there is a treaty then blood money should be paid to the diseased family in addition to setting free a believing slave, if this is not possible the murderer should fast for two successive months 4:92. The reward of one who kills a believer intentionally is hell 4:93. For deliberate murder retaliation is prescribed 2:178-179. Murder is prohibited 6:151, 17:33, 25:68, killing of children for fear of poverty is prohibited 6:151, 17:31, 60:12. Suicide is prohibited 4:29. 
 
Isa (PBH) was neither killed nor crucified but he was raised towards Allah (SWT) 4:157-158. In the battle of Badr Muslims did not kill their enemies but Allah (SWT) di d 8:17 Those killed in the path of Allah (SWT) are not dead but alive and are provided with sustenance 3:169, 2:154 they will be in paradise 47:4-6. One of the punishments of those who wage a war against Allah (SWT) and His messenger (PBH) and cause corruption in the earth is murder 5:33. Persecution is severer than slaughter 2:191. Place of murder (death) is fixed 3:154. Murder is associated with death 3:144. 

‘Qatala’ in Arabic literature also means ‘To disgrace’. It is probably in this sense that few derivatives have been used to convey the sense that opponents use to disgrace prophets and messengers 2:61, 2:87. Not even a single case of a murder of a prophet or a messenger is reported in the Quran, on the contrary Allah (SWT) saves them 10:103, numerous such events are reported: Nuuh, Saleh, Hud, Ibrahim, Musa, etc. (PBT)
