1571. AL QAMAR (The moon) 54:1 (ر م ق)

Allah (SWT) created the moon 21:33, it bows down to Him 22:18 i.e. it follows His command 7:54 and serves human beings 16:12 in keeping an account of time (months) 6:96 It rises 6:77. The moon is not a lamp like the sun 71:16 in which hydrogen burns to give light and heat but it is a heavenly body reflecting sunlight 91:2 and moon light is called Nuur 10:5, 25:61 which appears to be light without heat. The moon is a member of the solar system associated with the sun and planets 12:4, it moves in stages 36:39, in an orbit 21:33 till an appointed time (and not for ever) 31:29 and functions according to a calculation 55:5. We should not prostrate before the moon, but prostrate before Allah (SWT) who created it 41:37. The splitting of the moon was a miracle performed by Allah (SWT) through prophet Muhammed (PBH) 54:1.

When the universe ends the sun and the moon will be brought together when the moon will probably sink into the sun 75:8-9.
