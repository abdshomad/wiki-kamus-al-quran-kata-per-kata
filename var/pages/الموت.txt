88. AL MAWT (Death) 2:19 (ت و م)

(Also Hayaath meaning life and Wafaat meaning death). Allah (SWT) gives life causes death 3:156 and burial 80:21. He made every living thing from water 21:30. He take s away the nafs (soul, conscious self or the psychic personality) at the time of death and a person can die in his sleep too. The Nafs is take n away even during sleep 39:42 but life remains and the person rises on awaking 6:60. At the time of death both life and consciousness are taken away whereas during sleep only consciousness is taken away temporarily and returned on awakening. 

No human being is immortal i.e. every ‘Nafs’ tastes death 21:34-35. Allah (SWT) brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living, 3:27. 

There are two deaths and two lives 2:28, 40:11. Before coming into this world for ‘Hayaat id-duniya’ 43:32 human beings are biologically nonexistent and after the end of this first life too they become biologically nonexistent when the physical body is absorbed in the earth. On the day of resurrection human beings will rise bodily 75:3-4, 17:49-52 when the souls will be paired (probably with respective physical bodies) 81:7, the earth above them will split 50:44 and they will come out of the graves 70:43. Death can be defined as ‘Biological Nonexistence’, first before this life and second after it. Life in this world is biological existence and the presence of the Nafs or the psychic personality makes us active members of the human society facing the test for which we have been created 67:2. In the hereafter too i.e. our second life we will be biologically alive and conscious because we will be asked to read and examine our account of deeds 17:13-14, 10:30 and either enjoy in paradise which will include physical pleasures or suffer in hell which will include physical pains 69:18-37, 56:1-56. 

The place 3:154 and time 3:145 of death are fixed by Allah (SWT). Wherever we are death will grasp us 4:78 and we will be gathered towards Him 3:158. We do not know in which land will die 31:34 but we are ordered to die as Muslims 2:132, therefore every moment of our conscious life should be on Islam as we do not know when we will die. 

In this life too the dead were raised to life as miracles: a man kept dead for 100 years was raised to life 2:259 but he did not feel the length of time.

Isa (PBH) raised a dead man to life 3:49 by the permission of Allah (SWT). The intoxication of death i.e. sakraat-ul-mawt engulfs human beings at the time of their death 50:19, when the messengers (angels) take back the person 6:61 (the soul or the psychical personality). It is stated in the Quran: The angel of death Malak-ul-mawt who is entrusted with you will take you back (your soul) then to your Fosterer you will be returned 32:11. 

The angels take back the infidels (i.e. their souls) striking their faces and their backs, saying, “Taste the punishment of burning” 8:50, 47:27, the unjust thus suffer the hardships of death 6:93. In the case of the pious people the angels take back (their soul) saying “Peace be on you, enter the garden because of that which you used to do”. 16:32 the dead do not hear 27:80 and those slain in the way of Allah are not to be called dead, they are alive and get their provision from Allah (SWT) 2:154, 3:169, 22:58.

The earth is the place where we live and die and from which we will be brought out 7:25. The dead will be brought out of the earth like vegetation after the rain 7:57, 50:11. There is no death in paradise 44:56 but life in the exaggerated form 29:64, whereas in hell people will neither die nor live 20:74, 35:36, 87:13. 

Death is associated with fear 2:19, 2:243, murder 3:144 and grave 9:84, life and death are used as opposites of each other 16:21, 19:66, 35:22. 

Everything will perish except Allah (SWT) 28:88, 55:26-27. He is always Alive ‘Al Hayy’, Conscious and Attentive, being present everywhere 2:115. He does not die, does not sleep, does not become inattentive of His creation and does not get tired 2:255, 25:58. He gives life being ‘Al Muhyi’ ‘The Giver of life’ and causes to die being ‘Al Mumiit’ ‘One who causes death.
