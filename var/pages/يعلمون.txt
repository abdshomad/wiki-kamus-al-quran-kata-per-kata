55. YA-LAMUUN (They know) 2:13 (م ل ع)

A very important derivative of these alphabets is ‘Ilm’ meaning ‘knowledge’. There are some words which are better understood through their opposites and ‘Ilm’ appears to be one of them. 

The words used in the opposite sense of knowledge are, illiteracy, hear say, guess 2:78, desire 2:120, foolishness 6:140, forgery and lie 6:144, ignorance 12:89 unawareness 30:7. Knowledge should not be based on the above items but should be based on correct investigation 4:83 and proof 2:111. In this verse the term ‘Burhaan’ meaning proof is used in a sense opposite to ‘Amaaniyyu’ meaning desires which as seen above is opposite of knowledge. There should be no argument without knowledge 3:66. Knowledge is of two types (1) Divine 4:113, 4:175, 2:2 which is truth and just the truth. (2) Acquired through human efforts, when we are asked to travel in the earth 22:46 and observe and reflect on the universe and acquire knowledge 3:190-191.We are required to understand the Holy Quran in the light of the knowledge acquired by us as indicated in the Holy Quran :- ”..... He (Allah SWT) will say: Did you deny My signs and did not comprehend them in (your) knowledge or what was it that you did?” 27:84. All knowledge is bestowed to us by Allah (SWT) 2:255, 55:1-4, 2:31, 96:4- 5, 16:78. even the ship built by Nuh (PBH) was according to His communication 11:37. The ship appears to be the first invention of man but under Divine guidance. Are all other inventions and discoveries too under Divine guidance of which man is not  conscious ? Human beings have been given little knowledge 17:85 and Prophet Muhammed(PBH) was asked to pray for knowledge 20:114. Those who are really learned fear A llah(SWT) 35:28 and He exalts in degree those who believe and are given knowledge 58:11. Allah (SWT) knows everything 6:101. His Attributes Al Aliim, Al Aalim and Al Al- laam mean’ The Knower’, One Who knows.
