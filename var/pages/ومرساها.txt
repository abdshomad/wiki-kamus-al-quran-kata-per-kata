1080. MURSAAHAA (Its anchoring) 11:41 (و س ر)

Derivatives : Firmly fixed 34:13, mountains of sedimentary origin 13:3. 

When two land masses approach each other the sediment at the bottom of the ocean between them gets compressed and sometimes rises above the sea-level as mountains. A good example of this process is the Himalayan mountains which rose from the ocean named Tythus due to compression of the Indian sub continent towards Tibet during the continental drift. 

The word ‘Mursahaa’ is used for anchoring of ships in water. The anchor rests on the bottom of the ocean and is later lifted up above the sea-level. The word ‘Rawasiya’ from the same root alphabets, translated as ‘Mountains’, could mean those mountains, the material of which was originally deposited in water as sediment and later lifted up as sedimentary mountains. Here again one has to appreciate the selection of the most appropriate word-One single word demonstrates the whole process of the formation of sedimentary mountains.
