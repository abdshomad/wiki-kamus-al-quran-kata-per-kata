36. QULUUB-IHIM (Their Hearts or minds) 2:7 (ب ل ق)

Some of the derivatives of these root alphabets are used for :- Turning back of the human beings towards Allah (SWT) 29:21, turning of men during sleep 18:18, returning of human beings 48:12, movement of human beings 3:196, movement of hands 18:42, alternation of day and night 24:44, turning of hearts 24:37, turning of attention 22:11, turning away from Islam 3:144, upsetting of affairs 9:48, turning away of sight 67:4, etc. 

The opposite of movement is rest 47:19. ‘Qulb’ is therefore something which is always in movement, restless as opposed to being motionless or at rest. It is probably due to the continuous restlessness (beating) that the word ‘Qulb’ is used for ‘heart’ which is located in the chest 22:46 and there is only one heart 33:4. There are many verses of the Quran where the word ‘Qulb’ is used in the sense of ‘mind’ associated with the brain 22:46 which in turn is associated with knowledge 9:93 and understanding 7:179. It may be noted that the heart is an organ which pumps blood. After oxygenation in the lungs the blood reaches all the parts of the body, including the brain, supplying oxygen, salts, food etc. Consciousness is al so dependent upon the integrity of blood supply to the brain. Whenever the mental activity is quickened by any intellectual or emotional change, there is an instantaneous change in the blood supply which is regulated by the heart. Things which effect the brain, like thoughts, happiness, sorrow, worry etc, thus effect the heart instantaneously. This might be the reason for using the word ‘Qulb’ to mean ‘heart’ as well as ‘mind’. 

The good things associated with Qulb are :- Being defectless 37:84, turning in repentance 50:33, Quran 2:97, softening of, towards the remembrance of Allah (SWT) 39:23, belief 58:22, 49:7 & 14, guidance 64:11,  humble submission 22:54, 57:16, strengthening 8:11, 28:10, tranquility 48:4, satisfaction 2:260, 13:28, restrain, guarding against evil 22:32, 49:3, pity and mercy 57:27, unity among Muslims 3:103, purification 3:154, cleanliness 5:41, reconciliation 9:60, fear of Allah (SWT) 8:2, inclination 66:4 etc.
