168. TAABA (He turned mercifully)  2:37 (ب و ت)

‘Tawbah’ is translated as repentance i.e. to experience such sorrow for sin that it should produce amendment in life. The sequence of events after committing a sin for its forgiveness by Allah (SWT) is 1. Repentance 2. Belief 3. Righteous work and 4. Guidance on the straight path 20:82. In another sequence it is: 1. Repentance 2. Amendment 3. Holding fast to Allah (SWT) and ma king religion exclusively for Him 4:145-146 i.e. obeying only His orders by implementing the Quran as Prophet Muhammed (PBH) taught us to do. 

Repentance is thus a practical event or deed and not just a feeling or emotion of sorrow for a wrong ac t. For people whose repentance is accepted by Allah (SWT) their evil deeds are changed to good deeds because Allah (SWT) is protectively Forgiving and Merciful 25:69-71. 

Allah (SWT) accepts the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and repent soon. He does not accept the repentance of those who go on doing evil deeds until death and then repent nor for those who die as infidels, for such persons a painful punishment has been prepared 4:17-18. Allah (SWT) is the Acceptor of repentance ‘At tawwaab’ 9:104 He can forgive all sins 39:53. If people repent Allah (SWT) showers His mercy in this world too 11:52. The words associated with these derivatives are pity 9:117, mercy and love 11:90, wisdom 24:10, and when repentance is not accepted, a person is liable to be punished 3:128.
