217. BAARI-IKUM (Your purifier) 2:54 (أ ر ب)

Other derivatives: Freeing something from some other thing which is unwanted: cure i.e. freeing someone from the disease 3:49, leaders freeing themselves from the followers on the day of resurrection 2:166, Ibrahiim (PBH) freeing himself from his father 9:114 being free from associating partners with Allah (SWT) 6:19, “You are free from that which I do and I am free from that which you do” 10:41.

Few derivatives have been translated to mean bringing into existence 57:22 and creatures 98:6-7. This is again freeing something from non-existence and bringing it into existence.

One of the Attributes of Allah (SWT) is Al Baari translated as ‘The Purifier’. 59:24. Allah (SWT) originates the raw-materials of the universe, processes them and proportions them and in this process He removes unwanted things as Al Baari; The Purifier. This process can be illustrated by an example: We prepare tea by boiling proportionate amounts of tea leaves and water but to obtain the decoction we have to remove the boiled tea leaves by straining. This process of freeing the extraction from the tea leaves is ‘Baraa-’atun’, Allah (SWT) thus purifies by removing unwanted things. This Attribute is associated with many other Attributes mentioned in 59:22-24.
