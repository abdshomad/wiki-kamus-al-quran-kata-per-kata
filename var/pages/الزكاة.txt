184. Az ZAKAAH (Charity) 2:43 (ى ك ز)

Other derivatives: Purification (of soul) 91:9-10 (through wealth) 92:18, purification (of food) 18:19 and purification (of wealth) 9:103. Wealth belongs to Allah (SWT) 2:284, 24:33, 57:7. He distributes it among human beings according to His will 34:36. He orders that wealth should flow from the rich to the poor 59:7 in the form of ‘Zakaat’ and ‘Sadaqa’ 2:110, 9:60 and not in the reverse direction as ‘Riba’ or usury 30:39. Zakaat is treated as a loan given to Allah (SWT) Who returns it after multiplying it 73:20. Charity in the form of Zakaat or Sadaqa should not be followed by stressing one’s obligation or annoying 2:264. Those who do not give Zakaat possess one quality of polytheists 41:6-7 and polytheism is an unforgivable sin 4:48. 
 
The term Zakaat has been translated as Islamic tax, poor due, poor rate, charity etc. but these words fail to convey the real meaning of the term. This term appears to convey the dual meaning of personal purification and growth of the community through distribution of wealth. Technically it refers to the small part of the wealth of rich Muslims which was in their possession for one lunar year, which they give away to the poor Muslims as part of their religious duty, with a good intention of helping them to meet their essential expenses, seeking the Attention of Allah (SWT) 92:17-21. 

Zakaat is contrasted on personal level with sin and indecency 24:21 and 30 and with ‘Riba’ meaning usury on the social level 30:39, Allah (SWT) purifies whom He wills 24:21. These derivatives are associated with belief 9:18, holding fast to Allah (SWT) 22:78 Sadaqa (charity) 9:103, Salat 2:83, guarding against evil 7:156, repentance 9:5 cleanliness 2:232 etc.
