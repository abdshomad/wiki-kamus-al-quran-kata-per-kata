29. AA QHIRAT (Hereafter) 2:4 (ر خ أ)

Other derivatives Takhir, Aakhar, Ukhraa, Akhkhar, Taakhkhar etc convey the sense of postponement, giving time 15:5, 17:62, 4:77, second time 20:55, other 5:27, last 53:20, behind 3:153, delay as opposed to hastening 2:203, remain behind as opposed to advance 74:37, future as opposed to past 93:4, not to prefer or leave behind as opposed to prefer or send before 82:5 and life after death as opposed to life of this world 2:86. 

These derivatives in general, convey the sense of next to or after something. In view of this ‘Aakhirat’ would mean the period after death which obviously starts immediately after one’s death. Those who are certain of the life after death 2:4, the reward and punishment in paradise or hell, are those who guard against evil, they are on guidance and successful 2:2-5 because they will be in paradise 16:30-31. Contrary to this those who do not believe will be severely punished both here and in the hereafter 3:56. Angels are friends, in this world and in the hereafter, of those who say “Our Fosterer is Allah”, and are firmly established on it 41:30-32. 

We are invited to reflect on this world as well as the hereafter 2:219-220, probably on the comparative benefits and harm :- Provision of this world is comparatively little whereas the hereafter is better for those who guard against evil 4:77, there will be a severe punishment for the infidels who love this world more than the hereafter 14:2-3, for one who intends the reward of his good deed s to be given in the hereafter, it will be increased and given and for on e who intends that the reward of his good deeds be given in this world itself, Allah (SWT) will give what He wills and to whom He wills but there will be no portion for him in the hereafter 17:18-19, 42:20. 

The message we get from the above verses of the Quran is, that we should believe and act in accordance with the Quran and teachings of Prophet Muhammed (PBH) and prefer to receive the reward of our good deeds in the hereafter and not in this world but at the same time we should pray for good things to be given both in this world and the hereafter and safety from punishment, striving accordingly 2:201-202 because it is clearly stated in the Quran that the adornment and the good things from the provision of Allah (SWT) are not unlawful 7:32. 

Allah (SWT) states:” We help all, these (i.e. believers as we ll as those (i.e. infidels), from the bounty of your Fosterer, and the bounty of your Fosterer is not confined”17:20. What the believers or the infidels possess in this world is not the reward of their good deeds but something that Allah(SWT) has provided for testing them:6:165, 18:7, 20:131, 2:155, 3:186, 8:28.
