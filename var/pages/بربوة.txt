589. RABWAH (High place) 2:265 (و ب ر) 

High ground 23:50. The other meanings conveyed through the derivatives of these alphabets are (1) Elevation or being more in number 16:92,  (2) Severity  69:10,  (3) Swelling  resulting  in  growth  which  is literally opposite to barrenness 22:5, 41:39, (4)bringing up by parents 17:24, (5) increase 30:39, (6)usury 2:275. Those who swallow usury compare it with trade 2:275 but Allah (SWT) contrasts it with charity 2:276 and Zakat 30:39. Usury is prohibited 2:275-280, 3:130. ‘Riba’ or usury can be defined as the excess money taken on loans for allowing the debtor time for repayment. 

Riba thus involves flow of money from the poor to the rich which amounts to their exploitation and which is contrary to the instructions given in the Quran that money should flow from the rich to the poor 59:7. In ‘sadaqa’ or Za kat (i.e. charity) a rich man gives part of his wealth to the poor seeking the pleasure of Allah (SWT) 2:265 contrary to this in ‘Riba’ (i.e. usury) a ri ch man takes away part of the hard earned money of the poor, earning the displeasure of Allah (SWT) to the extent that He declares a war against those involved in ‘Riba’ Usury is thus strongly prohibited and on the contrary it is ordered that if the debtor is in difficulty he should be allowed more time for the repayment of his loan and if possible the loan should be converted to charity 2:278- 280. This clearly indicates that through the prohibition of usury actually the exploitation of the poor is prohibited: ‘Do not be unjust (taking money from the poor) and injustice will not be done to you’ 2:279.
